The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

The heritage of both Greece and Rome is a powerful one in the history of social thought, as it is in other areas of Western society. Very probably, apart from the initial Greek determination to study all things in the spirit of dispassionate and rational inquiry, there would be no social sciences today. True, there have been long periods of time, as during the Western <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://www.britannica.com/event/Middle-Ages" class="md-crosslink">Middle Ages</a>, when the Greek rationalist temper was lacking.

But it is partly this close relation between medieval theology and ideas of the social sciences that accounts for the different trajectories of the social sciences, on the one hand, and the trajectories of the physical and life sciences, on the other. From the time of the English philosopher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roger-Bacon" class="md-crosslink">Roger Bacon</a> in the 13th century, there were at least some rudiments of physical science that were largely independent of medieval theology and philosophy.

The first was the immense appeal of the Greek classics during the Renaissance, especially those of the philosophers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Plato" class="md-crosslink">Plato</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aristotle" class="md-crosslink">Aristotle</a>.

It would be hard to exaggerate the impact of Cartesianism on social and political and moral thought during the century and a half following publication of his <em>Discourse on Method</em> (1637) and his <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em> (1641). Through the Enlightenment into the later 18th century, the spell of Cartesianism was cast on nearly all those who were concerned with the problems of human nature and human society.</p><!--[P9]--><span class="marker p9"></span><div class="assemblies"><div class="w-100"><figure class="md-assembly card print-false" data-assembly-id="188951"><div class="md-assembly-wrapper" data-type="image"><a style="--aspect-ratio: 16/9" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://cdn.britannica.com/62/176962-050-4BC9F588/Rene-Descartes.jpg" class="position-relative d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center media-overlay-link card-media" data-href="/media/1/551385/188951"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947im_/https://cdn.britannica.com/w:690,h:388,c:crop/62/176962-050-4BC9F588/Rene-Descartes.jpg" alt="René Descartes" data-width="1260" data-height="1600" loading="lazy"><button class="btn btn-circle position-absolute shadow btn-white" aria-label="Zoom in"><em class="material-icons link-blue" data-icon="zoom_in"></em></button></a></div><figcaption class="card-body"><a class="md-assembly-title font-weight-bold mb-5 d-inline-block font-16 font-sans-serif media-overlay-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220202193947/https://cdn.britannica.com/62/176962-050-4BC9F588/Rene-Descartes.jpg" data-href="/media/1/551385/188951">René Descartes</a><div class="md-assembly-caption text-muted font-14 font-serif">René Descartes.</div><cite class="credit d-block mt-5">National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland</cite></figcaption></figure></div></div><!--[AM9]--><span class="marker AM9 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD9]--><span class="marker MOD9 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Great amounts of data pertinent to the study of human behaviour were becoming available in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The voluminous and widely published accounts of the great voyages that had begun in the 15th century, the records of soldiers, explorers, and missionaries who perforce had been brought into often long and close contact with indigenous and other non-Western peoples, provided still another great reservoir of data. Until the beginning of the 19th century, these and other empirical materials were used, if at all, solely for illustrative purposes in the writings of the social philosophers. Just as in the equally important area of the study of life, no philosophical framework as yet existed to allow for an objective and comprehensive interpretation of these empirical materials.
