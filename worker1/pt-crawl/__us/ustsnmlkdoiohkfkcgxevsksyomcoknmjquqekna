		 align="LEFT" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="3">"Racist" is a confusing word, and it should be clarified. Men have no
		  special rights simply because they belong to one race or another. Whey you say
		  "men," you have already imbued them with all their rights. Negroes, because they
		  are black, are not inferior or superior to any other men. Whites who say "my
		  race" commit the sin of redundancy; so do Negroes who say the same. Everything
		  that divides men, everything that specified, separates or pens them, is a sin
		  against humanity. To what sensible white person would it occur to be vain about
		  being white, and what do Negroes think about whites who are vain about being
		  white and think they have special rights as a result? What must whites think
		  about Negroes who are vain about their color? To insist on racial divisions, on
		  radical differences, in an already divided people, is to place obstacles in the
		  way of public and individual happiness, which can only be obtained by bringing
		  people together as a nation. Nothing inherent in Negroes prevents them from
		  developing their souls as men, and nothing that happens to them can limit their
		  innate ability. This fat should be stated and demonstrated, for there is much
		  injustice in this world and ignorant prejudice which passes for wisdom: there
		  are still those who, in good faith, believe that Negroes are not capable of the
		  same intelligence and courage as whites. It does not matter if you call this
		  defense of Nature racism, because it is no more than natural honesty and
		  heartfelt cry for peace and the country's well being. It is alleged that
		  slavery does not imply inferiority in the enslaved race, sine Gauls with blue
		  eyes and blond hair were sold as serfs with shackles around their necks in the
		  markets of Rome. This example helps make ignorant whites less prejudiced.
		  Negroes have the right to maintain and prove that their color does not deny
		  them any of the skills and rights of the rest of the human species.</P> 
		<P>What right do white racists, who believe their race is superior, have
		  for complaining about black racists, who see something special in their own
		  race? What right do black racists, who see a special character in their race,
		  have for complaining about white racists? White men who think their race makes
		  them superior to black men admit the idea of racial difference and authorize
		  and initiate black racists. Black men who proclaim their race-when what they
		  are really proclaiming is the spiritual identity that distinguishes one ethnic
		  group from another-authorize and incite white racists. Peace demands of Nature
		  the recognition of human rights; discrimination is contrary to Nature and 
		  the enemy of peace. Whites who isolate themselves also isolate Negroes. Negroes
		  who isolate themselves incite and isolate whites. </P> 
		<P>In Cuba, there is no fear of a racial war. Men are more than whites,
		  mulattos or Negroes. Cubans are more than whites, mulattos or Negroes. On the
		  field of battle, dying for Cuba, the souls of whites and Negroes have risen
		  together into the air. In the daily life of defense, loyalty, brotherhood and
		  shrewdness, Negroes have always been there, alongside whites. Negroes, like
		  whites, are divided by their character-timid or brave, self-sacrificing or
		  selfish-into the diverse parties in which men group themselves. Political
		  parties form around common concerns, aspirations, interests and characters.
		  Essential similarities are sought and found beneath superficial differences;
		  the common purpose is the fusion of that which is basic in the analogous
		  characters, even though they may be different in incidentals. In sum, the
		  similarity of characters, which is a superior uniting factor, outweighs the
		  inner frictions between men of varying color and the difficulties that, at
		  times, result. Affinity of character is more powerful than the affinity of
		  color. Negroes, consigned to the unequal or hostile pursuits of the human
		  spirit, will never be able to join, nor will they want to join, against whites
		  in like position. Negroes are too weary of slavery to enter voluntarily into
		  the slavery of color. Ostentatious men who are governed by self-interest will
		  combine, whether white or black, and the generous and selfless will similarly
		  unite. True men, black and white, will treat one another with loyalty and
		  tenderness, out of a sense of merit and the pride of everyone who honors the
		  land in which we were born, black and white alike. Negroes, who now use the
		  word "racist" in good faith, will stop using it when they realize it is the
		  only apparently valid argument that weak men, who honestly believe that Negroes
		  are inferior, use to deny them the full exercise of their rights as men. White
		  and black racists would be equally guilty of racism. Many whites have already
		  forgotten their color, as have many Negroes. Whites and Negroes are working
		  together to develop men's minds, to spread virtue and to promote the triumph of
		  creative work and sublime charity.</P> 
		<P>In Cuba, there will never be a racial war. The Republic cannot go
		  backwards. Ever since the day of redemption for Negroes in Cuba, ever since the
		  declaration of independence in Gu&aacute;imaro on April 10, civil rights,
		  granted by the Spanish Government for political expedience, were already
		  practiced prior to Cuba's independence and cannot now be denied-either by the
		  Spaniards who, as long as they breathe in Cuba, will continue dividing black
		  from white Cubans, or by those fighting for independence, who could never deny
		  in freedom the rights which the Spaniards recognized in servitude.</P> 
		<P>As for the rest, everyone will be free in the sanctity of his home.
		  Merit, the manifest and continuous evidence of culture, and inexorable trade
		  will eventually unite all men. In Cuba, there is much greatness, in both
		  Negroes and whites.</P> <SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript"><!--
