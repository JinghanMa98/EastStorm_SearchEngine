<hr>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was so lucky to get an
opportunity to talk with my former student Paris Defreitas this
semester, one of the busiest and most inspiring people I know!
Paris was in the first class I taught with the <a href=
"https://wikiedu.org/teach-with-wikipedia/">Wikipedia
assignment</a>: “Black Women and Creativity 1960-1980” at
Binghamton University in Spring 2024.&#160; Paris was then a
sophomore, a first generation university student majoring in
Philosophy, Politics, and Law and minoring in Africana Studies. She
was already a leader on campus, fostering creativity as the
Publications Coordinator of the Black Student Union and the editor
of the</span> <span style=
"font-weight: 400;">Vanguard</span><span style=
"font-weight: 400;">, a showcase for Black artistry.&#160; Paris
herself is a poet and a photographer, and creativity infuses
everything she does, including her scholarly research.&#160; Paris
is now in her first semester of a Master’s Degree in Public
Administration at Binghamton, a big step on her way toward her goal
of becoming an attorney and increasing the amount of Black women
lawyers in the US. It was thrilling to revisit our semester
together, reflecting on what we learned through learning to edit
Wikipedia and celebrating Paris’s intellectual journeys since then.
Enjoy our dialogue!</span></em></p>

<p><b>—&#160;</b></p>
<p><b>Jennifer Lynn Stoever:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi
Paris! It’s so great to catch up with you! It’s been a little over
a year since we worked on the Wikipedia assignment together.
Looking back, what do you think was the most valuable thing you
took from it?</span></p>
<p><b>Paris Defreitas:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I think
the most valuable thing I took from the <a href=
"https://wikiedu.org/teach-with-wikipedia/">Wikipedia
assignment</a> was the importance of well-sourced information to be
disseminated and accessible to the general public, especially the
role college students must play to make this possible. Universities
as conductors of research who have prolific libraries means that
they should contribute their part in making that information
available to communities so everyone can benefit from
it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that note, what do you hope
to accomplish in the use of Wikipedia assignments in your
classes?</span></p>
<p><b>JLS:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I really want
students to learn how knowledge is made, that there are politics
behind the status quo of history, especially regarding who is
remembered and represented and how their story is told.&#160; In
order to get a fuller and more accurate portrayal of our past and
present — one that’s more diverse and presenting multiple
perspectives — we need all hands on deck. I want to show students
that they can make interventions in the world of knowledge
production right</span> <i><span style=
"font-weight: 400;">now</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,
that they don’t have to wait! I want to give them the know-how,
support, and courage to make edits on Wikipedia and share the
information about Black history they are learning with their
friends, family and the world! We can all share the facts we have
learned from academic sources about people, communities and events
we care about, especially when we don’t see them in Wikipedia.
Students are powerful and their perspective really matters — and it
really matters right now!&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully you felt some of that
in our time together, and that working on editing a Wikipedia
article presented you with something different than a traditional
research paper assignment. Actually — how do you think the
assignment stacked up in comparison? What was different from
writing an individual paper assignment on the artist you chose,
LaToya M. Hobbs?</span></p>
<p><b>PD:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of how the
Wikipedia assignment was in comparison to a traditional research
assignment, there was a big difference in how citations were
sourced and written. There was a major difference in the technical
aspects of Wikipedia and in learning to remain neutral and
unbiased. In addition, a typical research paper usually has strict
guidelines in terms of page count, but for Wikipedia editing, it
was mostly based on how much you can gather from the sources you
found on your artist. This was perhaps the most significant
difference between a research report and crafting a Wikipedia
article from scratch.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new question for you: how will
you go about choosing the next batch of artists that you want your
students to focus on and build articles for? Would it be plausible
for future students to build on the artists from previous
classes?&#160;</span></p>
<p><b>JLS:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a great
question. I have done the Wikipedia assignment twice now. The first
time was in your class in Spring 2024, and I selected artists whose
paintings were in the university art museum because I wanted you to
be able to see their artwork up close. Last year I tried something
different. I came across these really fantastic&#160;oral histories
on Black artists published by</span> <i><span style=
"font-weight: 400;">BOMB Magazine</span></i> <span style=
"font-weight: 400;">that gave a great insight into the artists’
lives and gave students some starting places for their research and
a flavor of their voices right away.&#160; I selected four artists
who were working in the 1960s and ‘70s whose articles were
underdeveloped, and students selected from that
list.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really love the idea of having
students build from the articles of previous years of the class.
It’s definitely plausible! As much as I want to spread the love
around and get more artists’ articles built out, it’s also really
special to create ongoing links between students across time, to
work on a project larger than you.&#160; I know it meant a lot to
this years’ class when you came to the Edit-a-Thon with a couple of
last year’s students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of, was it like walking
into the room in Spring 2025 as an alumni of our class? What did
you reflect on?&#160;</span></p>
<p><b>PD:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I think this past
year walking into the room was very different than my year,
particularly due to the location. It’s really cool that the library
has been renovated to have an area specific for digital student
research, and I think a designated space can motivate students even
more. It was so cool to see my peers engaged in their projects,
informing me on their artists’ work, and teaching others how to
edit on Wikipedia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next time you teach the
class, will you refer to</span> <i><span style=
"font-weight: 400;">BOMB Magazine</span></i> <span style=
"font-weight: 400;">again to find artists? Or perhaps go a
different route?&#160;</span></p>
<p><b>JLS:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ooooh…I actually
don’t know yet! You have inspired me to look back and invite
“repeats” to see if we can improve the articles even more and
connect to previous classes’ work. I am also really interested in
building articles for early hip hop artists who haven’t been
recognized there, like Sheri Sher from Mercedes Ladies.&#160;
Besides</span> <i><span style=
"font-weight: 400;">BOMB</span></i><span style=
"font-weight: 400;">, there’s a really cool group called the Black
Lunch Table that hosts edit-a-thons and keep a running list
of&#160;</span><a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Black_Lunch_Table/Lists_of_Articles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black
Artists’ pages that need work.</span></a><span style=
"font-weight: 400;">&#160; It would be great to pull from that list
and formally partner with them.&#160; You know I am always trying
to connect with people!&#160;But I promise you’ll be one of the
first to know!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of futures, I know that
you went on to work with another professor on campus who you met at
the edit-a-thon your class hosted, Dr. Warren Harding, on a digital
archiving project last year for the Binghamton University Projects
for New&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undergraduate
Researchers (BUPNUR). Was this related to your work on the
Wikipedia assignment? How did the project inform your work there,
and in graduate school now as you are working on your Masters in
Public Administration and policy?</span></p>
<p><b>PD:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be cool to
see more light shed on women in hip-hop that were pioneers of the
genre! Thanks for letting me know and I look forward to learning
more about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participating in the Wikipedia
assignment definitely influenced me to continue research through
the BUPNUR program!&#160; In Spring 2025, I learned about computer
programming and it seemed very fitting, since it was for students
who haven’t done research in that way before. I was able to choose
from a bunch of professors to work with as advisors and a lot of
them were interesting to me!&#160;It was great to re-connect with
Dr. Harding and his digital research on Caribbean Women Creative
Writers was a similar project in terms of the people I chose to
shed light on in my research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also I chose both of them
because often in undergrad I wasn’t able to do longer-term digital
projects like in BUPNUR or BW&amp;C, so I really enjoyed doing more
research like that in literature and art.&#160; Doing research
really helped me for grad school, specifically because I am
interested in doing policy research and analysis. A lot of the
assignments within the program include research on values for
public administrators, policy briefing, and regulatory writing.
Although the research from the projects is different, in a way the
same skills are being applied.&#160; Black women are often
overlooked for their creativity and contributions, but the course
taught me well to find ways to bring their works to the forefront
wherever I am.</span></p>
<p><b>JLS:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s so powerful,
Paris! I am so proud of you and it has been such a pleasure to work
and learn together these past two years.&#160; One last
question,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">there are many
people out there thinking about working with the Wikipedia
assignment in 2026. What would you tell professors deciding whether
or not to try the assignment for the first time? Any advice for
students who might be nervous about taking on the Wikipedia
assignment in a class?</span></p>
<p><b>PD:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I think professors
should be more open to trying out the Wikipedia assignment. It is
very refreshing because it isn’t the typical “rinse and repeat”
research paper that is only done for a grade and usually stays in
the confines of simply being a submission for only the professor
and student to see. This project is also more collaborative rather
than individual, which is key in research. By taking on Wikipedia
editing, your students’ research has the ability to make a tangible
difference. The assignment has real substance in the sense that
students are working to shed more light on a topic for a wider
population that will continue to be shared, built, and expanded to
the world for years to come.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For interested students, I know
it is hard at first, but try not to be too overwhelmed by where to
start, because, really, you just have to start so you can really
see where the research and writing takes you. It is not
one-size-fits-all, and each participant can find the methods that
work best for them. Even expanding an article just a little bit can
be a catalyst for future Wikipedia editors to add more to an
article. You got this!</span></p>

<p>The first-ever <a href=
"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Leaders_Training_2025" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wiki Leaders Training
2025</a> brought together emerging Wikimedia leaders from across
Bangladesh for a two-day intensive learning experience on
<strong>24–25 October 2025</strong> in Cox’s Bazar. Organized by
<a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Bangladesh" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wikimedia Bangladesh</a>, the
initiative brought together promising contributors from across the
country for a journey that blended leadership development,
technical learning, and community-building. More than just another
training event, WLT 2025 signaled the beginning of a long-term
effort to nurture future leaders and strengthen the foundation of
regional Wikimedia communities.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A New Beginning: From Learners to
Leaders</h2>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class=
"wp-image-181908" height="1024" src=
"https://diff.wikimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Learners_to_Leaders_Wiki_Leaders_Training_2025_poster.png?resize=768%2C1024"
style="width: auto; height: 400px;" width="768"></figure>
</div>
<p>The theme, <strong>Learners to Leaders</strong>, captured the
spirit that guided every session and conversation throughout the
event. Participants arrived with different experiences and
backgrounds: some were deeply involved in local communities, others
had been running small activities with limited resources, and a few
were still discovering new aspects of the movement. Yet they all
shared one goal: to grow as leaders within the Wikimedia movement
and to foster stronger, healthier, and more collaborative
communities.</p>
<p>The program design reflected this aspiration. WLT 2025
emphasized:&#160;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developing leadership capacity</li>
<li>Strengthening a culture of mentorship</li>
<li>Ensuring safe and inclusive communities</li>
<li>Expanding outreach and GLAM partnerships</li>
<li>Encouraging long-term planning and sustainability</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than a lecture-heavy format, the training embraced
interactive sessions, group discussions, hands-on technical
sessions, and collaborative problem-solving—making the experience
both practical and inspiring the full spectrum of leadership
responsibilities within the Wikimedia ecosystem.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What the Training Focused On</h2>
<p>The two-day schedule was crafted to support emerging leaders who
are ready to take the next step in supporting their local
communities. The curriculum covered foundational leadership skills,
technical expertise, and strategic thinking relevant to Wikimedia
work in Bangladesh.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Community Leadership</h2>
<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>
<p>Sessions on leadership encouraged participants to think beyond
their individual contributions and consider how they could shape
healthier, more inclusive communities. They explored conflict
resolution, collaborative decision-making, mentorship strategies,
and ways to create space for new editors—especially in regional
groups where resources are limited.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Technical Skills for Community
Work</h2>

</div>
<p>Several hands-on sessions focused on Wikimedia tools, policies,
and workflows that leaders frequently use while guiding community
projects. Whether it was understanding global policies, conducting
large-scale campaigns, or addressing copyright issues on Wikimedia
Commons, participants received practical training aimed at
strengthening future program execution.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Outreach and Community Growth</h2>
<p>One of the main goals of WLT is to help communities grow
sustainably. Sessions covered how to design engaging outreach
events, measure impact, communicate effectively with institutions,
and represent Wikimedia confidently in academic, cultural, and
educational spaces.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">GLAM Engagement</h2>

<p>A dedicated portion of the training introduced the Group to the
fundamentals of GLAM collaboration. Participants explored how to
initiate conversations with museums, libraries, archives, and
cultural organizations, how to design meaningful content
partnerships, and how to document work for future learning and
replication.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sustainability and Long-term
Impact</h2>

</div>
<p>WLT also emphasised the responsibilities that come with
leadership, documenting work, maintaining community health,
ensuring continuity when leaders step away, and building
partnerships that can sustain local activities for years.
Discussions encouraged participants to look beyond short-term
projects and think about their long-term vision for their
communities.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Objectives: Building Confident Future
Leaders</h2>
<p>Throughout the event, the facilitators centered the training
around these key objectives:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Building a strong, meaningful network among
contributors across regions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Encouraging increased participation in nationwide and
thematic Wikimedia initiatives</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strengthening leadership and teamwork
skills</strong></li>
<li><strong>Promoting community health, safety, and
inclusivity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enhancing capacity for GLAM and outreach
activities</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improving long-term planning and documentation for
community-led work</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the program, participants were left with not just
new knowledge but also a clearer sense of purpose, direction, and
responsibility as future leaders.</p>

<p>As the inaugural edition, the Wiki Leaders Training 2025
successfully established a long-term vision for leadership
development within Wikimedia Bangladesh. Participants returned home
with a renewed sense of confidence and purpose. Many expressed that
the experience helped them see their role in the movement
differently—not just as contributors, but as facilitators, mentors,
and community-builders.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm and commitment shared by the group suggest that
WLT will continue to grow as an annual platform for learning,
connection, and leadership development.</p>
<p>Special thanks go to all participants and resource persons who
dedicated their time, experience, and energy to make Bangladesh’s
first Wiki Leaders Training a meaningful and memorable event.</p>

            <p>The Wikimedia Indonesia Outreach Program in <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aceh_Besar_Regency">Great Aceh
Regency</a>, held on 26-27 April 2025, marked an important step in
expanding the spirit of free knowledge to the westernmost part of
Indonesia. One notable aspect of this initiative was the presence
of a three-member team from the Wikimedia Medan Community, assigned
by the Wikimedia Indonesia Education Team to carry out direct
outreach in Great Aceh Regency, together with Dr. Teuku Afifuddin,
M.Sn., a lecturer from <a href=
"https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_Seni_Budaya_Indonesia_Aceh">
ISBI Aceh</a> who served as a key communication link. This
collaboration strengthened inter-community partnerships and further
solidified Wikimedia networks across Western Indonesia.</p>
<p>Over the course of two days, the program combined technical
training sessions with experience-sharing led by Wikimedia Medan
contributors. The main goal was to introduce and equip new
contributors, particularly students and lecturers, with the skills
and motivation to contribute to Indonesian Wikipedia and Acehnese
Wikipedia. This initiative is expected to pave the way for the
establishment of a local community in the region, the Wikimedia
Aceh Community, as a sustainable platform for contributors.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who Took Part?</strong></h2>
<p>Most participants who joined the WikiLatih Wikipedia training
were students, along with several lecturers from ISBI Aceh. Their
enthusiasm was remarkable, reflected in the diverse academic
backgrounds represented. Participants were especially excited when
they realized that their local language and cultural knowledge
could become part of a global movement for open access to
information.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Activities Were
Held?</strong></h2>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Day 1 – WikiLatih: Wikipedia
Editing Training</strong></h3>
<p>The first day focused on technical editing training on
Indonesian Wikipedia. The sessions covered:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An introduction to the Wikimedia movement and its various
projects</li>
<li>The principles of Wikipedia articles: collaborative, neutral,
and based on reliable sources</li>
<li>A step-by-step guide to creating and editing articles</li>
<li>Editing techniques such as adding headings, internal links,
categories, and references</li>
</ul>
<p>This hands-on session encouraged active participation, with many
participants successfully creating or improving articles for the
first time. By the end of the training, participants shared highly
positive impressions gaining new knowledge, finding the activity
enjoyable and beneficial for sharpening their thinking skills, and
feeling more confident in navigating Wikipedia.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Day 2 – Community Gathering &
Introduction to Acehnese Wikipedia</strong></h3>
<p>The second day took on a more relaxed tone with an offline
community gathering focused on Acehnese Wikipedia. The discussion
centered on:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The importance of documenting local knowledge and culture</li>
<li>The challenges and opportunities of writing in local
languages</li>
<li>How participants can contribute to preserving the Acehnese
language and identity through Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants responded enthusiastically, expressing pride in
taking part in efforts to preserve and promote the Acehnese
language through digital contributions.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stories from the Team:
Trainers and Organizers</strong></h2>
<p>We saw firsthand how hands-on, demonstrative learning can reduce
participants confusion when editing Wikipedia. Many who were
initially hesitant became enthusiastic after making their first
edits, even starting to ask deeper questions about how to improve
and expand their articles.</p>
<blockquote class=
"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“This activity is more than just teaching editing skills. We
want participants to feel that their knowledge in their own
language is valuable and deserves to be shared with the world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Can Be
Improved?</strong></h2>
<p>Based on reflections and participant feedback, here are several
points to consider for future outreach activities:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Focus on local content:</strong> Participants showed
strong interest in writing about Aceh’s culture, history, and
notable figures.</li>
<li><strong>Support for local languages:</strong> Dedicated
training on contributing in regional languages (such as Acehnese)
is highly needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Towards a Stronger
Community</strong></h2>
<p>The Wikimedia Indonesia Outreach in Aceh is just the beginning.
With participants now equipped with foundational knowledge and a
growing motivation to document local culture, we hope they will
continue contributing actively to both Indonesian and Acehnese
Wikipedia. This initiative also aims to support the formation of a
local community the Wikimedia Aceh Community.</p>
<p>The hope is that this spirit will not only inspire contributors
in Aceh, but also communities across other regions even around the
world to continue preserving and sustaining their local languages
through open-knowledge platforms.</p>
<p>Thank you to all participants for your passion and
contributions. Together, we are building bridges between language,
culture, and open knowledge.</p>

<p>The Likpakpaanl (also referred as
Konkomba/Likpakpaln/Bikpakpaam/Likpakpaaln /Likpakpal(n)) people
are ethnic group found mainly in northern Ghana and parts of
northern Togo are underrepresented on the Wikimedia space, a
situation that triggered the formation of the <a href=
"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Likpakpaanl_Language_Wikimedians">Likpakpaanl
Language Wikimedians</a>, a group dedicated to consciously bridging
this digital divide by carrying out Wikimedia projects on behalf of
the Likpakpaanl-speaking people. This project implemented
activities to introduce native Likpakpaanl speaking students of the
<a href="https://uds.edu.gh/">University for Development
Studies</a> (UDS) to key Wikimedia platforms like Translatewiki and
the Wikimedia Incubator, with the aim of building their
localization skills and supporting content creation for Likpakpaanl
as one of Ghana’s underrepresented languages, while also
introducing these participants to the Wikimedia movement,
free-knowledge principles, and the importance of digital language
preservation, thereby creating a strong foundation for
understanding the broader purpose of the project.</p>
<p>Training sessions were organized to support selected Likpakpaanl
students in creating accounts on both Translatewiki and the
Wikimedia Incubator. These sessions provided comprehensive
instruction on translating interface messages into the Likpakpaanl
language. Critical focus was placed on accurately translating and
reviewing the <strong>“Most Important”</strong> and <strong>“Most
Used”</strong> system messages to ensure high quality localization.
Through extensive hands-on practice, participants mastered
essential content creation skills, including adding content, data
boxes, incorporating references, and correcting formatting. This
practical methodology successfully reduced hesitation and prepared
the students for meaningful contributions. Subsequently,
participants actively created and improved articles within the
Wikimedia Incubator, laying crucial groundwork and contributing
foundational content necessary for the prospective development of a
Likpakpaanl Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The project achieved notable success in both localization and
content development. Specifically, <strong><a href=
"https://codelookup.toolforge.org/xon">587 messages</a></strong>,
representing 100% of the “Most Important” and “Most Used”
interfaces, were fully localized through translation on
Translatewiki. Additionally, <strong><a href=
"https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/Likpakpaanl_Wikimedia_Community/Launch_of_Likpakpaanl_Language_Wikimedians_and_Edit-a-thon_Contest">
98 new articles</a></strong> were successfully created within the
Wikimedia Incubator, significantly supporting the growth of the
emerging language Wikipedia. These efforts substantially increased
the digital literacy and editing competence among Likpakpaanl
students at UDS. New and returning editors gained considerable
confidence in using Wikimedia platforms, which simultaneously
raised community awareness about the vital importance of digital
language preservation and multilingual access to knowledge.
Ultimately, these tangible results demonstrate strong progress in
both language focused contributions and the establishment of a
sustainable foundation for a future Wikimedia community at UDS.</p>
<p>Several strategies were implemented that proved instrumental in
ensuring the project successfully achieved its stated objectives.
Practical, hands-on editing sessions conducted on platforms such as
Test Wiki and the Wikimedia Incubator significantly accelerated
student learning and knowledge retention. This environment of
experimentation, free from the immediate fear of making errors,
greatly encouraged active participation. Furthermore, grounding the
project in languages that participants already speak or deeply
connect with notably enhanced motivation, fostered a sense of
ownership, and resulted in more meaningful contributions. The
strategy of pairing students during both translation and editing
activities proved beneficial by boosting individual confidence,
improving collaborative problem-solving, and cultivating a
supportive peer-to-peer learning environment. Finally, the role of
experienced mentors in guiding participants through the complex
workflows of TranslateWiki, Test Wiki, and Incubator was crucial,
ensuring fewer errors, promoting quality contributions, and
guaranteeing continuous support for localization accuracy.</p>
<p>Throughout the execution of the key activities, including the
launch, Likpakpaanl language translations, and the organized
edit-a-thon, the project team actively reflected upon the learning
questions outlined in the initial proposal. The cumulative
experiences and outcomes of the project yielded valuable insights
that are essential for informing and guiding the structure,
methodology, and sustainability of future language documentation
and Wikimedia community initiatives. These insights offer a robust
foundation for scaling successful strategies and optimizing
approaches to digital language preservation. We learned that
participants were mainly inspired by a desire to promote and
preserve the Likpakpaanl digitally which invariably resulted in the
excitement of contributing to a global platform such as Wikimedia.
Through the project, participants have a unique opportunity to gain
new digital, translation, and editing skills and moreover it
creates a sense of pride that their language is being recognized
internationally. Knowing what motivates participants will help us
design future programs that emphasize language visibility, skill
development, and recognition. We will continue to highlight the
cultural impact of their contributions and create mentorship
opportunities that inspire long-term involvement.</p>
<p>Key challenges identified include, Limited internet access or
unstable connectivity. difficulty understanding some complex or
technical messages during translation. Limited experience with
Wikimedia editing interfaces among new participants. Competing
academic, economic and personal schedules that affect participation
consistency. Planning into the future, we will plan for offline
training materials, provide clearer translation guides, schedule
sessions more flexibly, and pair inexperienced editors with
mentors. We also intend to strengthen internet support for
workshops. We observed that collaborative discussion was crucial,
especially for scientific or technical terms that do not have
direct equivalents. Participants relied on consensus-building,
reference to local knowledge, and consultation with language
experts or elders. Creating a shared glossary of standardized terms
helped improve consistency in translations. Base on this finding,
we plan to formalize the glossary into a community dictionary for
use on TranslateWiki and in future editing events. This
collaborative model will be used for other complex domains such as
science, and technology.</p>
<p>Participants reported that the Incubator interface is manageable
but can be confusing for beginners. Navigation is not intuitive for
first-time users, especially when switching between translation,
article creation, and reviewing contributions. However, once
trained, participants appreciated the structured environment of the
Incubator. We will develop step-by-step guides and short video
tutorials for new editors. During training, we will allocate extra
time for hands-on practice. Strengthening peer support and
providing a dedicated helpdesk during events will also improve user
experience. The implementation of the <em>Launch of the</em>
Likpakpaanl Language Wikimedians and Edit-a-thon at the University
for Development <em>S</em>tudies saw a few unexpected situations
emerged. Many participants quickly adapted to editing on
TranslateWiki and the Test Wiki platform, which contributed to the
creation of 98 new Incubator articles and the translation of 587
most-used interface messages. This unexpected momentum strengthened
the overall impact of the project.</p>
<p>However, there were also challenges, unstable internet
connectivity caused interruptions during training sessions.
Additionally, some participants initially struggled with the
technical aspects of the platforms, requiring more time and support
than originally planned. These experiences offered valuable
lessons. First, the overwhelming interest highlighted the
importance of preparing to securing more internet support. Second,
the need for extended hands on guidance showed that future
workshops should include more facilitators and simplified
onboarding materials to help new editors learn at their own pace.
To ensure that the learnings and results benefit the wider
community, several dissemination strategies have been planned and,
in some cases, already initiated. The project outcomes such as the
translation of 587 most-used interface messages, creation of 98
Incubator articles, and overall participant experiences will be
documented and published on Meta-Wiki for open access by all
Wikimedia communities.</p>
<p>Additionally, a summary of the lessons learned has already been
shared informally with local Wikimedia groups through community
WhatsApp platforms and in-person discussions. Moving forward, we
plan to present the results during upcoming Wikimedia Ghana User
Group meetups and relevant online events, highlighting both the
successes and challenges faced working on underrepresented Ghanaian
languages, to adopt similar approaches. These efforts aim to ensure
that the knowledge gained contributes to broader capacity building,
cross-community learning, and continued growth of the Likpakpaanl
language within the Wikimedia movement.</p>

            <p>The world’s largest platform for global knowledge exchange,
<span class="wmf-wp-with-preview">Wikimania</span>, was held last
August in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. While editors and
volunteers worldwide were busy planning how to enrich their
respective language editions of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, the
co-founder of this free encyclopedia, took a break to meet with the
Bengali community. The conversation touched upon Bangladesh and the
progress and prospects of Bengali Wikipedia. His interview was
later broadcast on a <a href=
"https://rtvonline.com/english/interview/269794">national
television</a> station in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>According to Jimmy Wales, the true strength of Wikipedia lies in
its global communities. Nairobi was no exception; he was
particularly impressed by the lively presence of the Bengali
Wikimedians. With a smile, he remarked, “I’m really delighted to
see such vibrant Bengali Wikipedians here. You’re all wearing
fantastic T-shirts! We’re having a wonderful time together.”</p>
<p>Regarding Bengali Wikipedia’s current state, Wales said,
“Compared to the number of its speakers, Bengali Wikipedia is still
relatively small, but its rapid growth is highly encouraging.”</p>
<p>He views this progress as part of Wikipedia’s broader mission:
“Wikipedia is now about 25 years old. I hope that within the next
25 years, we’ll be able to realize our ultimate dream, making a
comprehensive, freely accessible encyclopedia available to every
person in the world in their own language.”</p>
<p>To ensure the sustainability of the Wikipedia movement,
particularly for new communities in Southeast Asia, Wales offered
several pieces of advice. One of them focused on welcoming new
editors. Addressing active Wikipedians, he said, “Pay attention to
newcomers. When someone makes an edit, go to their talk page and
write, ‘Thank you for your contribution! It was great to see your
edit.’ Introduce them to other experienced editors. When new
contributors receive sincere messages, they’ll begin to see
Wikipedia not merely as a website, but as a friendly and
collaborative community.”</p>

</figure>
<p>Speaking about the role of the <span class=
"wmf-wp-with-preview">Wikimedia Bangladesh</span> Chapter, he said,
“One of the major responsibilities of a chapter is to build
partnerships with local galleries, libraries, archives, museums,
and universities. Such collaborations can enrich and enhance the
reliability of Wikipedia’s information base.”</p>
<p>In today’s age of misinformation and polarization, Wales
emphasized the importance of Wikipedia’s neutrality: “We need to
represent ourselves accurately to the media. They must understand
that we are not Facebook or TikTok. we are a thoughtful,
collaborative movement. Our commitment to neutrality can even serve
as an inspiration for journalists.”</p>
<p>Back in 2014, Wales received an honorary degree of&#160;<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Letters">Doctor of
Letters</a>&#160;from Nobel laureate&#160;<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus">Muhammad Yunus</a>
<sub><sup>[<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales">1</a>]</sup></sub>, who
is now the Chief Adviser of <span class=
"wmf-wp-with-preview">Bangladesh’s interim government</span>. When
Yunus’ name came up, Wales’s tone became warm and nostalgic. He
said, “When I think of Professor Yunus, many memories come to mind.
He’s not only a <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview">Nobel Peace
Prize</span> laureate but also a remarkably bright, lively, and
compassionate person. His work inspires me deeply”.</p>
<p>Recalling his visit to Bangladesh, Wales added, “At that time, I
managed to meet a few Wikipedians, but it left me wanting more and
in a hopeful manner mentioned ‘I will try to revisit Bangladesh
with my family next summer.” Which I am certain would be welcomed
by the community in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Along with the reporter, <span class=
"wmf-wp-with-preview">Bengali Wikipedia</span> administrator Masum
Al Hasan Rocky, Wikimedia steward Muhammad Yahya, and Wikipedians
Dolon Prova, Nettimi Sujata, Anup Sadi, and Mohammad Zillur Rahman,

            <p>In late October to early November, I had the opportunity to
attend my very first <a href=
"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM_Wiki_2025">GLAM Wiki
Conference in Lisbon, Portugal</a>. The experience was inspiring,
and I left with new insights, tools, and strategies that I’m
excited to apply to my work.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, GLAM stands for Galleries, Libraries,
Archives, and Museums. The GLAM Wiki community brings together
cultural institutions and Wikimedia contributors to collaborate on
making knowledge more accessible and open.</p>
<p>I went into the conference with three main goals: to learn, to
share, and to collaborate. As the leader of my community, I’m
constantly guiding our GLAM-related projects, so I was eager to
discover new methods, share our experiences, and explore potential
collaborations particularly through our involvement with the TAROCH
Coalition now, <a href=

Heritage Coalition</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Key Takeaways from the Conference:
Rethinking Partnerships and Open Knowledge</h3>
<p>One of my biggest takeaways from the conference was the
importance of clearly defining roles and responsibilities when
partnering with museums and other cultural institutions. It’s easy
to assume that museums understand open access and copyright, but
that’s not always the case. It’s essential to start with clear
communication and mutual understanding. <strong>This was
highlighted during the <em>WikiResilience: Surviving a GLAM Partner
Project</em> session by Pru and Kerrie, where they emphasized the
need for transparent, ongoing dialogue to ensure successful
collaboration.</strong></p>
<p>I also learned that a partnership doesn’t have to end after an
initial failure. If the first attempt doesn’t work, it’s often
smarter to re-strategize and start with small, manageable projects
that can gradually build trust. Many of the conference sessions
focused on practical, step-by-step approaches that demonstrate the
value of these partnerships over time.</p>
<p>A highlight for me was discovering <a href=
"https://humaniki.wmcloud.org/">Humaniki</a>, a project that
creates an open dataset about the gender, birthdate, birthplace,
and language of content related to human subjects across Wikimedia
projects, especially Wikipedia biographies. This tool was
introduced during Camelia’s session, “Women’s Sign: Empowering
Collective Memory through Open Knowledge”.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=
"https://diff.wikimedia.org/?attachment_id=181669"><img alt=""
class="wp-image-181669" height="771" src=
"https://diff.wikimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_40db0d.jpeg?resize=1024%2C771"
width="1024"></a></figure>
<p>Humaniki is powerful because it helps to visualize gender and
content gaps in the representation of human biographies. By showing
who is represented and who is missing. It empowers editors,
organisers, and partners to take targeted action to close these
gaps. I’m excited to integrate this tool into our community’s
efforts to raise awareness and guide meaningful contributions.</p>
<p>Projects That Inspired Me: Making Women’s Contributions
Visible</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=
"https://diff.wikimedia.org/?attachment_id=181670"><img alt=""
class="wp-image-181670" height="784" src=
"https://diff.wikimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_f0cd5c.jpeg?resize=1024%2C784"
width="1024"></a></figure>
<p>One of the most inspiring aspects of the conference was learning
about projects dedicated to amplifying the voices of women,
especially those whose contributions have been forgotten or
overlooked by history.</p>
<p>Here are a few projects that particularly stood out:</p>
<p><a href=
"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM_Wiki_2025/Program/Commons_Gallery">
Digitization of Women’s Handwritten Traces</a>: The Italian Women’s
Library in Bologna is preserving handwritten notes, signatures, and
dedications from women authors, intellectuals, and actresses. These
documents offer a personal connection to history and a glimpse into
the lives of women whose stories were often sidelined.</p>
<p>The <a href=
"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GLAM_Wiki_2025_-_Female_researchers_in_the_National_Archives_of_Spain_by_Wikiesfera.pdf">
Spanish Women Researchers Project</a>: A year-long initiative that
highlights the contributions of Spanish women researchers between
1900 and 1970. Many of these women did not have photographs, but an
illustrator was commissioned to bring their presence to life. The
project aims to ensure these women are remembered and
recognized.</p>
<p><a href=
"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM_Wiki_2025/Program/Commons_Gallery">
Curated Wikimedia Collections</a>: A new portfolio platform,
<a href="https://commons.gallery/">Commons Gallery</a> for
Wikimedia Commons users and GLAM institutions to showcase curated
collections of media. This initiative will help boost visibility
for underrepresented stories and encourage storytelling that
highlights diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>These projects were a powerful reminder that visibility is a
form of justice. By ensuring women’s contributions are not erased,
we can help future generations better understand the richness and
complexity of history.</p>
<p>Open Culture on a Global Stage: The Open Heritage Coalition</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href=
"https://diff.wikimedia.org/?attachment_id=181672"><img alt=""
class="wp-image-181672" height="884" src=
"https://diff.wikimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_bf9b96.jpeg?resize=1024%2C884"
width="1024"></a></figure>
<p>It was great to have Dee Harris from Creative Commons discuss
the Open Heritage Coalition and introduce the&#160;<a href=
"https://openheritagestatement.org/">Open
Heritage&#160;Statement</a>. This global movement aims to secure
UNESCO’s adoption of meaningful recommendations for open culture.
The initiative stresses the importance of community-driven
engagement at the local level to drive global advocacy.</p>
<p>The good news is that several Wikimedia affiliates have already
joined this initiative, working to ensure that UNESCO adopts
policies that promote open access to cultural heritage.</p>
<p>If you care about open culture and global access to knowledge,
now is the time to get involved. Whether through outreach,
advocacy, or simply raising awareness, every contribution makes a
difference.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Quotes That Stayed With Me</h2>
<p>As I reflect on the conference, a few quotes continue to
resonate deeply with me:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>“We can’t talk about access without
documenting.”</strong></li>
<li><strong>“Access builds on understanding, rather than deleting
it.”</strong>– Filipa Oliveira</li>
<li><strong>“The future of museums depends on the relationships
they build with artists and communities.”</strong>– Filipa
Oliveira</li>
</ul>
<p>These quotes capture the essence of why we do this work:
<strong>to preserve knowledge, make it accessible, and ensure no
one is forgotten</strong>.</p>
<p>GLAM Wiki 2025 wasn’t just a conference. It was a reminder of
why we do this work: to preserve, to open up knowledge, and to make
sure no one is forgotten. If you have used tools like Humaniki or
know other tools that have supported you as an organiser or editor,
I would love to hear about them. Your experience might inspire
someone else to take their next step.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Appreciation</h2>
<p>I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the GLAM Wiki 2025
organisers for making this experience possible. Your support
allowed me to attend, learn, and engage with a community that is
truly empowering.<br></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Join the Conversation</h2>
<p>GLAM Wiki 2025 wasn’t just a conference, it was a powerful
reminder of the importance of our collective work. I’m excited to
apply the insights and tools I’ve gained, especially those like
Humaniki, which will help us identify gender and content gaps
within our community.</p>
<p>If you’ve used tools like Humaniki or know of other resources
that have helped you as an organiser or editor, I’d love to hear
about them. Your experiences might inspire others to take their
next step toward more inclusive, open knowledge.</p>

            <p>On November 20, 2025, we gathered for our second workshop under
the <strong>Wiki Loves Sports 2025 campaign</strong>. This time,
the spotlight was on the <strong>Kiswahili Wiktionary</strong>
project (Wikamusi). Our annual rhythm is simple but powerful: one
workshop dedicated to Wikipedia, followed by another for
Wikamusi.</p>

<p>We kicked things off with a campaign to spread the word. First
through our WhatsApp group, then across our social media channels,
and finally via Google Forms for registration. Since Wikamusi
doesn’t yet support event pages, we built one on Wikipedia itself:
<a href=

Event: Wiki Loves Sports 2025 — Wikamusi</a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Workshop Flow</h2>
<p>The session began at 10:00 a.m. with <strong>Dr. Aneth
David</strong> leading facilitation. She shared practical tips,
welcomed late registrants, and guided participants through the
selection of sports-related words to work on. Around 23
participants joined in, filling out their chosen terms here:

<p>Ruby and Anita brought a wave of inspiration. Ruby, who had
personally funded her trip to Tanzania for the cancelled
Wikiindaba, shared her passion with our youth. Together, they
delivered short motivational sessions that sparked curiosity and
joy. Participants asked questions, we shared lunch, and capped the
moment with a group photo outside the University of Dar es Salaam
Library.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>As participants departed, the organizers—<strong>Jenga Wikipedia
ya Kiswahili</strong> (Aneth David and Muddyb) and
<strong>Wikimedia Tanzania</strong> (Antoni Mtavangu and Otto
Nyongole)—remained with Ruby and Anita to reflect on the
collaborative future of Wikimedia in Africa.</p>
<p>It was a day filled with learning, laughter, and love. A
reminder that our movement is not just about editing pages, but
about building connections and nurturing community.</p>

<p>As the Wikimedia movement was preparing for WikiIndaba 2025, set
to take place in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a dedicated pre-session
technical training was held on 25 October 2025 to build awareness
and readiness among Tanzanian tech contributors. The session
focused on developing the technical skills and confidence needed to
participate meaningfully in Wikimedia’s open-source and data driven
projects and ultimately, to contribute effectively to the upcoming
WikiIndaba 2025 Hackathon that was unfortunately canceled.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Purpose of the Training</h2>
<p>The <strong>Wikimedia Tanzania Technical Training</strong>
served as an <strong>awareness and capacity-building</strong>
session for emerging and active tech contributors within the
Wikimedia ecosystem.<br>
Its main goals were to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Introduce participants to Wikimedia’s technical ecosystem
including APIs, bots, extensions, and data tools.</li>
<li>Prepare local contributors for the upcoming WikiIndaba 2025
Hackathon, enabling early engagement and team formation.</li>
<li>Strengthen Tanzania’s local technical community and its
connection to the global Wikimedia tech network.</li>
<li>Encourage the inclusion of African languages, especially
Kiswahili, in Wikimedia technology development.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interactive online session, held on October 25, 2025,
focused on practical exposure to Wikimedia’s technical tools and
collaboration platforms.<br>
Participants were guided through the essential workflows that power
Wikimedia’s open-source ecosystem and learned how to engage as
contributors in global tech projects.</p>
<p>Key agenda items included:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Introduction to Wikimedia’s developer ecosystem: understanding
how Wikimedia projects are built and maintained through open
collaboration.</li>
<li>Hands-on session on Git and GitHub: exploring version control,
code contribution workflows, and open-source best practices.</li>
<li>Working with Wikimedia Phabricator: learning how to track

development process.</li>
<li>Exploring Wikimedia open-source tools such as the ISA Tool and
other community-driven tech initiatives.</li>
<li>Team collaboration and idea sharing: participants brainstormed
ideas and discussed how to contribute to Wikimedia technical
projects such as WikiIndabas and Wikimania Hackathons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sessions were facilitated by:</h3>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Eugene233</strong> (@eugene233,
<strong>Udehb-WMF</strong> @udehb, and <strong>Fongoh</strong> from
<em>Wiki Mentor Africa</em></li>
<li><strong>Olimasy</strong> – <em>Wikimedia Tech Community
Coordinator, Tanzania</em></li>
<li><strong>Jadnapac</strong> – <em>Wikimedia Community User Group
Tanzania Lead</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Outcomes</h2>
<p>The pre-session achieved several important milestones for the
Tanzanian Wikimedia technical community:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Raised awareness among local contributors about the hackathon

contributors.</li>
<li>Organize follow-up workshops and meetups leading up to the
Hackathons to maintain engagement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking Ahead to WikiIndaba 2025
Hackathon</h2>
<p>As the WikiIndaba 2025 Hackathon was canceled but Tanzanian
contributors are were gearing up to participate in projects such
as:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Building tools to support African language integration on
Wikimedia platforms.</li>
<li>Developing mobile and web applications that support Wikimedia
editing and data contribution.</li>
<li>Creating bots or scripts that improve content quality and data
accuracy across Swahili Wikipedia and Wikidata.</li>

            <p>More than 600 young people engaged with Wikimedia projects and
microbial technology through the Microworld exhibition in Jujuy,
Argentina. Over two days (November 26–27), <strong>as shown in the
video below</strong>, the initiative demonstrated how microbes and
open knowledge can spark curiosity and connect new generations with
Wikimedia in meaningful ways.</p>

Microworld is a Wikimedia-fueled microbial science outreach
exhibition</a> led by <a href=
"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedistas_de_Jujuy">Wikimedistas
de Jujuy</a> in northern Argentina. The group is an independent
volunteer community that strengthens Wikimedia’s presence in Jujuy
through key partnerships with educational, scientific, and
governmental institutions. <strong><a href=
"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Luisfff2812">Luis Fernando
Flores</a></strong> coordinates these Wikimedia efforts and is a
<a href="https://youtu.be/HTtXhF_MKJA?t=229">Wikimedia Youth
Conference 2025 fellow</a>, leading initiatives focused on creating
new entry points for participation, developing innovative outreach
strategies, and expanding access to free knowledge in areas that
remain underrepresented in Argentina.</p>
<p>The Microworld exhibition addressed the persistent negative view
of microorganisms, which are often associated only with disease or
contamination. The initiative shows that microbes play essential
roles in ecosystem health, food production and biotechnological
innovation. Promoting awareness of their diversity and importance
in everyday life is key to strengthening microbiological literacy.
The project began three months ago with training sessions for
pre-service Biology teachers in Wikimedia editing and in preparing
audiovisual resources, all based on Wikimedia Commons. Students
also guided visitors through a dynamic experience that combined
art, science and technology. More than 50 microbiology related
Wikipedia articles were improved and over 30 freely licensed files
from Wikimedia Commons enriched the exhibition and explained
microbial processes in a clear and accessible way.</p>
<p>More than 600 students from primary and secondary schools viewed
microbial cultures taken from everyday surfaces, observed microbes
under the microscope, explored physical models, and participated in
interactive games designed around the Sustainable Development
Goals, microbial concepts, and the Wikimedia ecosystem. <strong>The
<a href=
"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Micromundo_(Microworld)_exhibition_in_Jujuy_Argentina,_16x9.webm">
video</a> showcases these activities</strong>, with youth recorded
from behind whenever possible, and their faces blurred when not.
The program also introduced open licenses and highlighted the role
of Wikipedia in the age of artificial intelligence. The event
concluded with three short talks on microbiological research
conducted in Jujuy, providing an academic closing to the
experience.</p>
<p>Microworld was made possible thanks to the dedication of
pre-service Biology teachers from the <strong>Instituto de
Educación Superior Número 5 José Eugenio Tello</strong>, the
Wikimedia training provided by <strong>Wikimedistas de
Jujuy</strong>, the academic and technological support of the
<strong>Institute for Cellular, Genetic, and Molecular
Studies</strong>, and the coordination of the <strong>Agency for
Science, Technology, and Innovation of the Government of
Jujuy</strong>. The audiovisual exhibition was free for attendees
and entirely volunteer-driven. It presents an interinstitutional
collaborative model that Wikimedia communities and affiliates may
find valuable as the movement prepares to celebrate the
<strong>twenty-fifth anniversary of Wikipedia</strong> in 2026.</p>
<p>A full project report with metrics and all multimedia materials
will be released in the coming weeks. Additional videos, interviews
and behind-the-scenes content will be shared on the <a href=

<p>On 25th October, the Wikimedia community in Lafia joined the
global celebrations for <strong>Wikidata’s 13th birthday</strong>
with a vibrant event focused on learning, community, and open
knowledge.</p>
<p>The gathering brought together newcomers and experienced editors
for a fun, celebratory experience. Instead of a formal training,
participants enjoyed <strong>Wikidata-themed games</strong>,
explored and <strong>tested community tools</strong>, and engaged
in light editing activities that showcased the joy of contributing
to open knowledge. The day was filled with laughter, teamwork, and
creative exploration — all while celebrating Wikidata’s impact and
growing community.</p>

<p>We also raised our glasses in a cheerful toast to <strong>how
far Wikidata has come in just 13 years</strong> — from a small
experiment in structured data to one of the world’s most impactful
open knowledge projects. It was a joyful moment of appreciation for
the global community whose passion continues to shape and expand
Wikidata every day.</p>

spoke on November 18th, has been contributed with <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap">OSM</a> for many
years, a database that collects information on various local
locations. He emphasized the importance of using open data and
international platforms if we want to preserve local information
for the future. He also shared several specific examples of
projects he has been contributed with, such as the <a href=
"https://countries-romantic.connpass.com/">Shokoku Roman</a>,
<a href=

Memories Map</a>. Furthermore, during the forum, he showed us OSM
screens from Japan and overseas, giving us a clear understanding of
the contribution of volunteers from all over the world.</p>

would happen if a university researcher tried editing
Wikipedia?”</h2>
<p>At the final forum on November 23rd, Yoju Ito of Shiseikan
University spoke in detail about the process of editing an article
about his research subject, Ryukyu Kingdom politician <a href=
"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%BD%E5%9C%B0%E6%9C%9D%E7%A7%80?_fsi=Nk9yMlEG">

to gather opinions on whether or not to include original research.
Opinions on this point may differ depending on the subject and the
Wikimedians involved. In any case, this is something that is being
done with the consensus of the community, so it is important to
follow these steps.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>※　※　※</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, these online forums allowed us to hear from six
Wikimedians on various fronts, and also brought to light a variety
of issues. I hope to use this experience in future projects. Nearly
100 people participated in the forums, and we were able to share
and discuss the Wikimedia world. I would like to thank all the
speakers and audience members.</p>

<p>Wikipedia will mark its 25th anniversary on January 15, 2026. No
one could have predicted 25 years ago that Wikipedia would grow
into the backbone of knowledge on the internet it is today—powering
search engines, voice assistants, and generative AI tools.</p>
<p>Today, nearly 250,000 volunteers generously give their time and
energy to update Wikipedia, add citations, build consensus, and
more. They keep knowledge human. In 2025, people spent an estimated
2.4 billion hours reading English Wikipedia articles, according to
data from the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that operates
Wikipedia and <a href="/what-we-do/wikimedia-projects/" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">other Wikimedia free
knowledge projects</a>. The top 20 most-read English Wikipedia
articles of 2025 outlined below focus on politics, popular culture,
and loss.</p>

<p>The most-read article on English Wikipedia this year covered
Charlie Kirk, a US political activist, entrepreneur, and media
personality who was assassinated in September at a university
campus debate he organized. In the day afterwards, people viewed
the article about Kirk nearly 15 million times, or an average of
over 170 times per second. Across 2025, about 43% of the views on
Kirk’s article came from outside the US.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Coming in the #2 spot is “Deaths in 2025,” an article that has
never been lower than third on our annual list of most-read
articles. This annual article is updated by English Wikipedia’s
volunteer editors when they find published obituaries that come out
after the deaths of <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">notable individuals</a>. With
eight billion people in the world, there are a large number of
notable deaths to update the page with each
day.<sup>1</sup>&#160;</p>
<p>One of those deaths in 2025 was Pope Francis. The first Latin
American to become pope, Francis served for 12 years before passing
away in April. The Catholic Church selected his successor, Pope Leo
XIV, a few weeks later. As people rushed online to learn about Leo,
traffic to all Wikimedia projects peaked at around 800,000 hits per
second—more than 6x over normal traffic levels, and a new all-time
record for us. Plenty of people came to learn more about Francis’
life too; his English Wikipedia article was the 11th most-read of
the year.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump entered the office for the second time
on January 20, 2025. He is appearing on English Wikipedia’s annual
most-read articles list for the eighth time. Since 2015, the
English Wikipedia article about Trump has <em>not</em> appeared in
that list only in 2022 and 2023.</p>

<p>For about a decade, we have published a list of the most-read
English Wikipedia articles. In almost all of those years, the film
and television you consumed, binged, and enjoyed have held
prominent positions. 2025 is no different. Part of the reason is
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_screen" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">second screen effect</a>,
meaning as you watch the latest movie or TV show, you open
Wikipedia to learn more about the production, actors, or more;
others <a href=

"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">read Wikipedia’s plot
summaries to get all the spoilers</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>This year, eight articles highlight this pop culture
phenomenon:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ed Gein, the US serial killer, appears as a result of Netflix’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster:_The_Ed_Gein_Story"
rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">latest season of
<em>Monster</em></a><em>.</em> Only about half of the views to
Gein’s article came from inside the US, demonstrating the show’s
global reach despite being focused on US crimes. The subjects of
<em>Monster</em>‘s previous seasons (<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dahmer" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Jeffrey Dahmer</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyle_and_Erik_Menendez" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Lyle/Erik Menendez</a>) were
also highly popular on the English Wikipedia in <a href=
"https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2024/12/03/announcing-english-wikipedias-most-popular-articles-of-2024/"
rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">2024</a> and <a href=
"https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/2022-as-you-saw-it-on-wikipedia-9021d3c3d1a2"
rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">2022</a>,
respectively.</li>
<li>Ryan Coogler’s <em>Sinners</em> and Zach Cregger’s
<em>Weapons</em> were two of the most successful films this year at
the US box office. Their powerful stories, visuals, and (in
<em>Sinners</em>‘ case) music led to them being the first-ever
horror entries in all our years of doing these lists.</li>
<li>The first season of <em>Severance</em>, a US Apple TV show,
came out three years ago to rave reviews, but its cultural impact
was nothing like this year’s second season. That change can be
illustrated through the lens of the English Wikipedia: our page
view data shows that it only received about five million hits in
2022, but nearly tripled that in 2025.</li>
<li><em>Adolescence</em>, a British Netflix show, has garnered wide
attention not just for its acting and storyline, but for its
episodes that were shot as one continuous take with no hidden cuts.
Pageviews to this article peaked ten days after the show’s release,
perhaps as more people discovered it.</li>
<li>The final three articles are the superhero mainstays from DC
and Marvel, including the latest <em>Superman</em> and
<em>Fantastic Four</em> reboot, and Marvel’s attempt to craft a
“new Avengers” through <em>Thunderbolts*</em>.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p>One article that just missed this list was <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>KPop Demon
Hunters</em></a>, the animated musical that has taken the world by
storm since its release last June. According to Netflix, the film
is their “<a href=

<p>Politics was another major subtheme in the English Wikipedia’s
most-read articles of 2025. Five of the top twenty articles fall
into this category. In addition to Charlie Kirk and US President
Donald Trump, discussed above, two other articles are related to
people who hold or have held prominent roles in the US
administration: Vice President JD Vance and former senior advisor
Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Ozzy Osbourne, the rock singer/reality show star that was also
known as the “Prince of Darkness,” passed away in July.&#160;</p>
<p>MrBeast, the internet personality with the most-popular YouTube
channel on the planet, entered the list for the first time this
year. Although millions of people have watched his YouTube videos
for years, views to his Wikipedia biography spiked in January after

<p>Twenty-five years ago, Wikipedia was just a dream. Today, it is
the backbone of knowledge on the internet.</p>
<p>The free online encyclopedia’s 25th birthday is coming on 15
January. It will be a time to celebrate the accomplishments of the
nearly 250,000 volunteers who help maintain the site every day by
keeping its content neutral, its facts cited to reliable sources,
and more. Their work represents humanity at its best—the humans of
today, organizing themselves to benefit the humans of tomorrow.</p>

<li><sup>1</sup> While Wikipedia’s <a href=
"https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Privacy_policy" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">strict privacy policy</a>
means that we do not have a number for repeat visitors to the
“Deaths in 2025” page, our assumption is that a good portion of
these views are regular and returning readers that come to read
those updates. In addition, Wikipedia’s volunteers split the
article into smaller month-by-month lists to keep its overall
length at a reasonable size. As of publishing time, the page covers
December 2025—but if you’re reading it in January 2026, the page
will be redirected to Wikipedia’s “<a href=

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>All of the pageviews include direct and <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Redirect" rel=
"noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">indirect</a> navigations to
the pages in question.</li>
<li>This list has been screened for false positives with methods
including:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cross-referencing the pageviews against the percentage of views
they received from desktop devices, as extreme values of less than
2% or more than 80% correlates strongly with spam, botnets, or
other concerns. This affected articles like Cleopatra, a long-time
false positive; XXXTentacion; and .xxx.</li>
<li>Looking at the number of pageviews that did not have a referrer
and removing articles with extremely high values. This impacted a
number of articles about large websites, such as Facebook, and
browsers like Google Chrome. We suspect that a significant number
of the pageviews without referrers are mistakes that occur when
viewers are trying to access those.</li>

from bigger issues. The situation is made worse when misguided
philosophies are peddled by governments that put economics ahead of
ecology. The pursuit of easily gamed targets like GDP is easier
than ecological amelioration since money is a man-made and
controllable entity. Nationalism, pride, other forms of chauvinism,
the creation of enemies, and the magnification of war threats are
all effective tools in the arsenal of <a href=

<div style="text-align: justify;">There is a very interesting book
in German by Eugeniusz Nowak called "<i>Wissenschaftler in
turbulenten Zeiten</i>" (or scientists in turbulent times) that
deals with the lives of ornithologists, conservationists and other
naturalists during the Second World War. Preceded by a series of
recollections published in various journals, the book was published
in 2010 but I became aware of it only recently while translating
some biographies into the English Wikipedia. I have not yet
actually seen the book (it has about five pages on Salim Ali as
well) and have had to go by secondary quotations in other content.
Nowak was a student of <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Stresemann" target=
"_blank">Erwin Stresemann</a> (with whom the first chapter deals
with) and he writes about several European (but mostly German,
Polish and Russian) ornithologists and their lives during the
turbulent 1930s and 40s. Although Europe is pretty far from India,
there are ripples that reached afar. Incidentally, Nowak's
ornithological research includes studies on the expansion in range
of the collared dove (<i>Streptopelia decaocto</i>) which the
Germans called the Türkentaube, literally the "Turkish dove", a
name with a baggage of cultural prejudices.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Nowak's first paper of
"recollections" notes that: <i>[he]</i> <i>presents the facts not
as accusations or indictments, but rather as a stimulus to the
younger generation of scientists to consider the issues, in
particular to think “<b>What would I have done if I had lived there
or at that time?</b>” -</i> a thought to keep as you read on.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">A shocker from this period is a
paper by Dr <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnther_Niethammer" target=
"_blank">Günther Niethammer</a> on the birds of Auschwitz
(Birkenau). This paper (read it online <a href=
"https://archive.org/stream/DieVogelweltVonAuschwitz#page/n0/mode/1up"
target="_blank">here</a>) was published when Niethammer was posted
to the security at the main gate of the concentration camp. You
might be forgiven if you thought he was just a victim of the war.
Niethammer was a proud nationalist and volunteered to join the Nazi
forces in 1937 leaving his position as a curator at the Museum
Koenig at Bonn.</div>

Auschwitz and also shot ducks in numbers for himself and to supply

do go to the linked article / or search for the name online).&#160;
Upon the death of Niethammer, an obituary (open access <a href=
"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1975.tb04230.x/pdf"

1975 - a tribute with little mention of the war years or the fact
that he rose to the rank of <span class="sp-ssp"><span class=
"sp-ssp">Obersturmführer</span></span>. The Bonn museum journal had
a special tribute issue noting the works and influence of
Niethammer. Among the many tributes is one by Hans Kumerloeve
(starts <a href=
"https://archive.org/stream/bonnerzoo252619741975zool#page/n27/mode/1up"
target="_blank">here</a> online). A subspecies of the common jay
was named as <i>Garrulus glandarius hansguentheri</i> by Hungarian
ornithologist Andreas Keve in 1967 after the first names of
Kumerloeve and Niethammer. Fortunately for the poor jay, this name
is a junior synonym of&#160; <span class="sp-ssp"><i>G. g.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="sp-ssp">Now for
Niethammer's friend Dr Kumerloeve who also worked in the Museum
Koenig at Bonn. His name was originally spelt <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kummerl%C3%B6we" target=
"_blank">Kummerlöwe</a> and was, like Niethammer, a doctoral
student of <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Meisenheimer" target=
"_blank">Johannes Meisenheimer</a>. Kummerloeve and Niethammer made
journeys on a small motorcyle to study the birds of Turkey.
Kummerlöwe's political activities started earlier than</span>
<span class="sp-ssp"><span class="sp-ssp">Niethammer, joining the
NSDAP (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei = The
National Socialist German Workers' Party)</span>&#160; in 1925 and
starting the first student union of the party in 1933.</span>
<span class="sp-ssp">Kummerlöwe soon became a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnenerbe" target=
"_blank">Ahnenerbe</a>, a think tank meant to provide "scientific"
support to the party-ideas on race and history. In 1939 he wrote an
anthropological study on "Polish prisoners of war". At the museum
in Dresden that he headed, he thought up ideas to promote politics
and he published his ideas in 1939 and 1940. After the war, it is
thought that he went to all the European libraries that held copies
of this journal (Anyone interested in hunting it should look for
copies of</span> <i><span class="st">Abhandlungen und Berichte aus
den Staatlichen Museen für <i>Tierkunde</i> und <i>Völkerkunde</i>
in Dresden</span></i> <span class="st">20:1-15.) and purged them of
the article which would incriminate him. According to Nowak, he
even managed to get his hands (and scissors) on copies of the
journal held in Moscow and Leningrad!&#160;&#160;</span><br>
<br>
<span class="st">The Dresden museum was also home to the German
ornithologist <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Bernhard_Meyer" target=
"_blank">Adolf Bernhard Meyer</a> (1840–1911). In 1858, he
translated the works of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace
into German and introduced evolutionary theory to a whole
generation of German scientists. Among Meyer's amazing works is a
series of avian osteological works which uses photography and
depicts birds in nearly-life-like positions (wonder how it was
done!) - a less artistic precursor to Katrina van Grouw's 2012 book
<i>The Unfeathered Bird</i>. Meyer's skeleton images can be found
<a href=
"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Abbildungen_von_Vogel-Skeletten"
target="_blank">here</a>. In 1904 Meyer was eased out of the
Dresden museum because of rising anti-semitism. Meyer does not find
a place in Nowak's book.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">In the first of his "recollection
papers" (<a href=
"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01653343" target=
"_blank">his 1998 article</a>) Nowak writes about the reason for
writing them - noticing that the obituary for Prof. <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Sch%C3%A4fer" target=
"_blank">Ernst Schäfer</a>&#160; was a whitewash that carefully
avoided any mention of his wartime activities. And this brings us
to India. In a recent article in <i>Indian Birds,</i> Sylke
Frahnert and coauthors have written about the bird collections from
Sikkim in the Berlin natural history museum. In <a href=
"http://indianbirds.in/pdfs/IB7.6_FrahnertETAL_Schafer.pdf" target=
"_blank">their article</a> there is a brief statement that
"<i>The&#160; collection&#160; in&#160; Berlin&#160; has&#160;
remained&#160; almost&#160; unknown due&#160; to&#160; the&#160;
political&#160; circumstances&#160; of&#160; the&#160;
expedition</i>". This might be a bit cryptic for many but the best
read on the topic is <i>Himmler's Crusade: The true story of the
1939 Nazi expedition into Tibet</i> (2009) by Christopher Hale.
Hale writes:&#160;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">He [Himmler] revered the ancient cultures
of India and the East, or at least his own weird vision of
them.<br>
These were not private enthusiasms, and they were certainly not
harmless. Cranky pseudoscience nourished Himmler’s own murderous
convictions about race and inspired ways of convincing
others...<br>
Himmler regarded himself not as the fantasist he was but as a
patron of science. He believed that most conventional wisdom was
bogus and that his power gave him a unique opportunity to
promulgate new thinking. He founded the <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnenerbe">Ahnenerbe</a>
specifically to advance the study of the Aryan (or Nordic or
Indo-German) race and its origins</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">From there, Hale goes on to
examine the motivations of Schäfer and his team. He looks at how
much of the science was politically driven. Swastika signs dominate
some of the <a href=
"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Deutsche_Tibet-Expedition_Ernst_Sch%C3%A4fer"
target="_blank">photos from the expedition</a> - as if it provided
for a natural tie with Buddhism in Tibet. It seems that Himmler
gave Schäfer the opportunity to rise within the political
hierarchy. The team that went to Sikkim included <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Beger" target="_blank">Bruno
Beger</a>. Beger was a physical anthropologist but with less than
innocent motivations although that would be much harder to ascribe
to the team's other pursuits like botany and ornithology. One of
the results from the expedition was a film made by the entomologist
of the group, Ernst Krause - <i>Geheimnis Tibet</i> - or secret
Tibet - a copy of this 1 hour and 40 minute film is on <a href=
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HskdtYx_MCI" target=
"_blank">YouTube</a>. At around 26 minutes, you can see Bruno Beger
creating face casts - first as a negative in Plaster of Paris from
which a positive copy was made using resin. Hale talks about how
one of the Tibetans put into a cast with just straws to breathe
from went into an epileptic seizure from the claustrophobia and
fear induced. The real horror however is revealed when Hale quotes
a May 1943 letter from an SS officer to Beger - ‘<i>What exactly is
happening with the Jewish heads? They are lying around and taking
up valuable space . . . In my opinion, the most reasonable course
of action is to send them to Strasbourg . . .</i>’ Apparently Beger
had to select some prisoners from Auschwitz who appeared to have
Asiatic features. Hale shows that Beger knew the fate of his
selection - they were gassed for research conducted by Beger and

<div style="text-align: justify;">In all, Hale makes a clear case
that the Schäfer mission had quite a bit of political activity
underneath. We find that <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Hedin" target="_blank">Sven
Hedin</a> (Schäfer was a big fan of him in his youth. Hedin was a
Nazi sympathizer who funded and supported the mission) was in

<div style="text-align: justify;">Issues arising from race and
perceptions are of course not restricted to this period or region,
one of the less glorious stories of the Smithsonian Institution
concerns the honorary curator <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wilson_Shufeldt" target=
"_blank">Robert Wilson Shufeldt</a> (1850 – 1934), who, in the
infamous <i>Audubon affair,</i> made his personal troubles with his
second wife, a grand-daughter of Audubon, into one of race. He also
wrote such books as <a href=
"https://archive.org/details/americasgreatest00shuf" target=
"_blank"><i>America's Greatest Problem: The Negro</i></a> (1915) in
which we learn of the ideas of other scientists of the period like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Drinker_Cope" target=
"_blank">Edward Drinker Cope</a>! Like many other obituaries,
Shufeldt's is a classic <a href=

given to the Nobel prize winning Konrad Lorenz for his support of
the political setup and racial beliefs. It should not be that hard
for scientists to figure out whether they are on the wrong side of
history even if they are funded by the state. Perhaps salaried
scientists in India would do well to look at the legal contracts
they sign with their employers, especially the state, more
carefully. The current rules make government employees less free
than ordinary citizens but will the educated speak out or do they
prefer shackling themselves.&#160;</span><br>

<li>Mixing natural history with war sometimes led to tragedy for
the participants as well. In the case of Dr <a href=

expert on leprosy to visit the borders of Afghanistan with

<li>Apparently Himmler's entanglement with ornithology also led him
to dream up "Storchbein Propaganda" - a plan to send pamphlets to
the Boers in South Africa via migrating storks! The German
ornithologist <a href=

be honest, I'm planning on removing another page starting next

way to make writing about it substantial or at least less

<p>A member of the convention's organizing team, <a class="extiw"
href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:GiovanniPen" title=
"meta:User:GiovanniPen">Giovanni Pennisi</a>, shared partial
results of a poll sent to participants with <i>The Signpost</i>.
The participants were mostly active on Wikipedia, Wikidata and
Commons; over 25 people said they had taken part in a national
convention for the first time; while the majority of participants
were aged 31 or older, about twenty of them were aged between 18
and 30; some users from <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title=
"Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title=
"France">France</a> and <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title=
"Belgium">Belgium</a> took part in the event, and over twenty
people received a travel scholarship. Finally, many of the
participants stated that they felt "more like a part of the
community", that they were "more motivated to contribute" and that
they understood more clearly "the issues of Wiki projects and the
community".</p>

<p>The success of the latest itWikiCon served as a step forward
towards the ambitious goals of the WikiSud collective. It showed
that, even in territories where volunteers face more systemic
obstacles and many people still feel forced to leave in order to
get better chances for their studies or their professional careers,
local communities can still thrive and work together to bring a
glimpse of hope and positive changes for their lands.</p>

<p><i>inconsistencies</i>, a specific type of factual inaccuracy
[on English Wikipedia], and introduce the task of <i>corpus-level
inconsistency detection</i>. We present CLAIRE, an agentic system
that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface potentially
inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5%
reported higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants
identified 64.7% more inconsistencies in the same amount of
time.<br>
Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE,
the first benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random

<p>Takeaways:<br>
- Contradictions are measurable and fixable at scale.<br>

WikiCollide) but are effective copilots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors <q class="inline-quote-talk">focus specifically on
internal inconsistencies</q>, which they define as</p>
<blockquote style=
"padding-left: 1.0em; padding-right: 1.0em; background-color: #eaf8f4;">
<p>contradictory facts within Wikipedia that indicate errors
requiring correction through consultation of original sources. In a
crowdsourced repository, inconsistencies can arise from outdated
information, limited awareness of related content during editing,
or simple human error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They illustrate this notion with an example (still not yet
corrected on-wiki at the time of writing) drawn from FEVEROUS, a
Wikipedia-derived dataset published in 2021 whose rate of
inconsistencies was found to be even higher (7.3%):</p>
<blockquote style=

"François, Duke of Châtellerault">François de
Bourbon-Montpensier</a> was born in 1492 and received the title
“duchy-peerage of Châtellerault” in 1515. However, the Wikipedia
table [rather, infobox in] “<a href=
"/wiki/Duke_of_Ch%C3%A2tellerault" title=

states that the title was created 23 years earlier.</p>

<p>CLAIRE (Corpus-Level Assistant for Inconsistency REcognition), a
system for surfacing inconsistencies in large corpora. [...] CLAIRE
finds and displays not only candidate contradictions but also
disambiguating context and explanations of specialized terminology.
It features an interactive interface implemented as a browser
extension that surfaces potential inconsistencies to Wikipedia
visitors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Unfortunately, that browser extension doesn't yet seem to have
been released as part of <a class="external text" href=
"https://github.com/stanford-oval/inconsistency-detection" rel=

<p>CLAIRE is then used to facilitate a (manually confirmed) lower
bound estimate of the overall frequency of inconsistent facts on
Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote style=
"padding-left: 1.0em; padding-right: 1.0em; background-color: #eaf8f4;">
<p>Applying CLAIRE to 700 atomic facts uniformly sampled from
Wikipedia articles, we identified 44 potentially inconsistent
facts, of which 23 were manually confirmed inconsistent. With 99%
confidence, we estimate that approximately 3.3% ± 1.7%[1.6%, 5.0%]
of all facts in Wikipedia contradict other information in the
corpus. This is a lower bound, as CLAIRE may miss inconsistencies
[...] Extrapolated to the entire encyclopedia, this corresponds to
between 37.6 million and 121.9 million inconsistent facts,[...]
underscoring the need for systematic inconsistency detection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors then present their own WIKICOLLIDE dataset,
<q class="inline-quote-talk">consisting of 955 atomic facts drawn
from Wikipedia [using a snapshot from November 1, 2024], each
manually labeled as either consistent or inconsistent with the
corpus.</q> This sample was drawn from a subset of articles (Level
5 Vital Articles) and deliberately biased to <q class=
"inline-quote-talk">prioritize facts more likely to be
inconsistent</q>. It is thus not representative of Wikipedia as a
whole. However, the paper's classification of the types of
inconsistencies present in this corpus should still give an idea of
which are most frequent on Wikipedia:</p>

limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations
and outdated information.[...] we introduce WikiContradict, a
benchmark consisting of 253 high-quality, human-annotated instances
designed to assess LLM performance when augmented with retrieved
passages containing real-world knowledge conflicts. We benchmark a
diverse range of both closed and open-source LLMs [...] we also
introduce an automated model that estimates LLM performance using a
strong open-source language model, achieving an F-score of 0.8.
Using this automated metric, we evaluate more than 1,500 answers

<p>"[...] Wikipedia editors use a wide range of maintenance tags to
flag problematic content for improvement. However, these
maintenance tags are typically removed when creating Wikipedia
datasets for LLM pre-training, which results in content with
various quality issues being included in the pre-training
process.<br>
In this work, we focus on three tags that indicate content
inconsistencies: <i>inconsistent</i>, <i>self-contradictory</i>,
and contradict-other. The first two tags denote contradictory
statements within the same article, whereas the third tag
highlights instances where the content of one article contradicts
that of another article. In total, we collect around 1,200 articles
that contain these tags [...]</p>

leads to factual inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and
reliability of the encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on

cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's structured content,
with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual

<p>"We construct a novel dataset that integrates Wikipedia revision
histories with metadata from Retraction Watch, Crossref, Altmetric,
and OpenAlex, identifying 1,181 citations of retracted papers. We
find that 71.6% of all citations analyzed are problematic. These
are citations added before a paper's retraction, as well as the
citations introduced after retraction without any in-text mention
of the paper's retracted status. Our analysis reveals that these
citations persist for a median of over 3.68 years (1,344 days).
Through survival analysis, we find that signals of human attention
are associated with a faster correction process. Unfortunately, a
paper's established scholarly authority, a higher academic citation
count, is associated with a slower time to correction."</p>

<p>From the "Discussion" section:</p>
<blockquote style=
"padding-left: 1.0em; padding-right: 1.0em; background-color: #eaf8f4;">
<p>"A key consideration is the role of automated tools, such as
RetractionBot [25]. This bot exemplifies the specialized roles that
automated agents play in Wikipedia’s quality control ecosystem
[66]. It primarily serves an editorial audience. By systematically
adding a prominent template to the reference section, the bot is
highly effective at its specific task of signaling a source’s
retracted status to editors engaged in verification and
maintenance. [...] However, our work highlights a persistent gap
between the effectiveness of automation for these specific, often
editor-facing tasks and the challenges of repairing more nuanced,
epistemic issues for a general reader. This distinction is key:
while a bot can efficiently apply a “technical flag,” this action
is distinct from the substantive, contextual repair required to
update an article’s main text."</p>

To do so, we analyze how often an external source was referenced in
Wikipedia articles in which either a problem with reliability was
identified or a previously identified problem was solved. From the
frequency of the respective occurrences, we aim to draw conclusions
about a positive or negative influence of the source on the
trustworthiness of new Wikipedia articles. For this, we use the

I'm working on a somewhat related side project to create a <a href=
"/wiki/Knowledge_graph" title="Knowledge graph">knowledge graph</a>
of the entire Wikipedia lichenology corpus. The lichenology
knowledge graph (KG) is the canonical representation of "atomic
facts", and Wikipedia presents the noisy realisations of that graph
in prose form. Every time text is created or updated, an LLM+parser
layer extracts structured <a href="/wiki/Semantic_triple" title=
"Semantic triple">semantic triples</a> from the prose. Those
triples are then matched against the existing lichen KG. Where they
agree, nothing to do. Where they introduce a genuinely new fact,
the KG gets a candidate update (pending human review). Where they
conflict with existing triples, they get routed into an
"inconsistency queue" very much in the CLAIRE/WIKICOLLIDE spirit,
but now with strong domain-specific semantics rather than generic
Wikipedia-wide heuristics. The KG is what lets you be much more
precise than generic "3.3% of facts contradict something
somewhere". One can build lichen-specific constraint layers: (1)
taxonomic constraints (a species should not simultaneously belong
to two different accepted families at the same time slice; a genus
must have one type species; certain combinations of
rank+name+authority must be unique); (2) nomenclatural constraints
(authority–year patterns that are allowed vs implausible; synonym
relationships that should be one-way, not circular); (3)
biogeographic/eco constraints that are at least suspicious
("endemic to Tasmania" vs "widespread in boreal North America"
without any explanation); and (4) chemistry constraints (e.g. one
article saying "contains only atranorin and fumarprotocetraric
acid" while another, or another section, says "lacks
fumarprotocetraric acid and instead has protocetraric acid"). Many
of these can be encoded as <a href="/wiki/SHACL" title=
"SHACL">SHACL</a>-style rules or hand-rolled checks on the graph;
the text layer only needs to be good enough at mapping sentences to
those schema slots. <a class="new" href=

<p>For one month beginning on October 5, I ran an experiment: Every
day, I asked <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/ChatGPT_5" title=
"ChatGPT 5">ChatGPT 5</a> (more precisely, its "Extended Thinking"
version) to find an error in "<a href=
"/wiki/Wikipedia:About_Today%27s_featured_article" title=
"Wikipedia:About Today's featured article">Today's featured
article</a>". In 28 of these 31 featured articles (90%), ChatGPT
identified what I considered a valid error, often several. I have
so far corrected 35 such errors.</p>
<p>This experiment was inspired by an October 2 <a class=

<p>This caught my interest as a Wikipedian with over 50,000 edits

<p>I ran this query towards the end of each TFA's time on the main
page, or shortly afterwards. I verified all the alleged errors
myself to the best of my ability (often spending considerable time
to first familiarize myself enough with the topic and the relevant
sources), and provide my verdict on each below. Whenever I agreed
that something was an error, I fixed it in the article (with a few
exceptions, explained below), without taking up ChatGPT's
suggestion to provide the correction itself (or, in the few cases
where it already suggested a corrected wording, e.g. for the
<a href="#Oct_31">Oct 31</a> article, <a class="mw-redirect" href=

<p>The idea to use LLMs to fact-check Wikipedia articles is not
new. A few examples of related efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group of Stanford researchers recently announced a paper
titled "Detecting Corpus-Level Knowledge Inconsistencies in
Wikipedia with LLMs", reporting e.g. that "at least 3.3% of English
Wikipedia facts contradict another fact", and building a browser
extension to assist Wikipedia editors in finding them. See <a href=

title=
"Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2025-12-01/Recent research">this
issue's "Recent research"</a>.</li>
<li>In 2022, a team from Facebook AI Research/Meta presented
<q class="inline-quote-talk">a neural network based system, called
Side, to identify Wikipedia citations that are unlikely to support
their claims</q> (<a href=

However, it <a class="external text" href=

rel="nofollow">never made it</a> beyond the proof of concept
stage.</li>
<li>In 2024, the Wikimedia Foundation issued a $5000 grant to
develop "<a class="extiw" href=

<li>Of course, many editors have already experimented with using
previous versions of ChatGPT and other LLM chatbots to review
articles, checking citations, etc. (See e.g. a list by the recently
created <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Tools" title=
"Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Tools">WikiProject AI Tools</a>)</li>
<li>Most recently, several Wikipedia editors have used the
AI-generated corrections applied by <a href="/wiki/Grokipedia"
title="Grokipedia">Grokipedia</a> to the articles it imported from
Wikipedia to fix the same error in the source Wikipedia article.
(See e.g. <a href=

</span>A few observations about this experiment</h4>
</div>
<ul>
<li>This used <b>a recent paid version of ChatGPT</b>, specifically
the "ChatGPT 5 Thinking" <a href="/wiki/Reasoning_model" title=
"Reasoning model">reasoning model</a>, using the "Extended
Thinking" setting, where a request can take up to several minutes
to complete. <a class="external text" href=
"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/6/research-goblin/" rel=
"nofollow">This post</a> by <a href="/wiki/Simon_Willison" title=
"Simon Willison">Simon Willison</a> (who nicknamed it a "Research
Goblin" for its persistence in going through lots of possible
sources) should provide an idea about what this model can be good
and less good at. Presumably, one can get good results from the
reasoning versions of competitors like Claude or Gemini as well,
but the limitations of the free version of ChatGPT might make it
less useful with this prompt.</li>
<li>This experiment can be seen as <b>a Wikipedia-specific
benchmark for LLMs</b> (or LLM agents). With AI steadily improving
in general but still miserably failing at many tasks, it can be
difficult to keep track of where current models stand with regard
to specific tasks that would be helpful to one's own work. This is
why experts like <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Mollick" title=
"Ethan Mollick">Ethan Mollick</a> have been recommending to
would-be AI users to create their own small benchmark with a few
tasks that they care about and feel competent to evaluate, and test
different models on them over time (as part of "<a class=
"external text" href=
"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/giving-your-ai-a-job-interview"
rel="nofollow">Giving your AI a Job Interview</a>"). The results
here can be seen in this vein. I would love for us to come up with
more such benchmarks that evaluate LLMs on such tasks that may be
useful for assisting Wikipedia editors, and keep evaluating LLMs on
them over time. Many Wikipedians have already volunteered to do
similar manual evaluation work for various external AI research
projects by academics (for example, the Stanford study on
inconsistency detection mentioned above).</li>
<li>As mentioned, the <b>evaluation of this benchmark</b> has been
quite time-consuming, partly because I was aiming to reach a solid
verdict even in topic areas I'm not familiar with myself, but also
because of the inherent effort of fact-checking work in general
(e.g. acquiring sources, etc.). This illustrates another <a class=
"external text" href=
"https://bsky.app/profile/emollick.bsky.social/post/3m6gal57lnc24"
rel="nofollow">remark</a> by Mollick: "It is getting harder and
harder to test AIs as they get 'smarter' at a wide variety of
tasks," because evaluating the validity of the results on less
trivial tasks requires more effort and expertise from human
evaluators.</li>
<li>If repeating this experiment, I would <b>modify the prompt to
facilitate systematic analysis</b> of the results, e.g. by
requiring the LLM to produce structured output, and also confine it
to one error per article only.</li>
<li>The results presented here are <b>already outdated</b>: Shortly
after I ran the last daily query using <a class="mw-redirect" href=
"/wiki/ChatGPT_5" title="ChatGPT 5">ChatGPT 5</a>, OpenAI announced
<a href="/wiki/GPT-5.1" title="GPT-5.1">ChatGPT 5.1</a>, promising
fewer hallucinations among other improvements.</li>
<li>In my impression there is still room for more systematic
approaches that use AI to fact-check Wikipedia articles statement
by statement (like some of the projects mentioned under "Related
efforts"). That said, I also think that this experiment illustrates
how such <b>custom-built AI projects might sometimes get
overtaken</b> by the improving general capacities of the big AI
lab's models, such as ChatGPT.</li>
<li>The "at least one" in the prompt is deliberately aggressive,
and seems likely to force hallucinations in case an article is
definitely error-free. So, while the sample here (running the
prompt only once against a small set of articles) would still be
too small for it, it might be interesting to investigate using this
prompt to produce <b>a kind of article quality metric</b>: If it
repeatedly results only in invalid error findings (i.e. what a
human reviewer <span><a class="mw-file-description" href=
"/wiki/File:Symbol_declined.svg"><img alt="no" class=
"mw-file-element" height="19" src=
"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Symbol_declined.svg/20px-Symbol_declined.svg.png"
width="18"></a></span><b>&#160;Disagree</b>s with), that should
indicate that the article is less likely to contain factual
errors.</li>
<li>Conversely, this experiment could also be conceived as a
small-scale <b>study of featured articles</b>. (Personally, I find
it a little bit reminiscent of <a href=
"/wiki/User:HaeB/Citizendium_approved_errors" title=
"User:HaeB/Citizendium approved errors">a small examination</a> I
did many years ago by hand, collecting errors in <a href=
"/wiki/Citizendium" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>'s "approved
articles", which that Wikipedia competitor – launched by <a href=
"/wiki/Larry_Sanger" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a> – had
highlighted as being of superior quality. Or also of the page
<a href=
"/wiki/Wikipedia:Errors_in_the_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_that_have_been_corrected_in_Wikipedia"
title=
"Wikipedia:Errors in the Encyclopædia Britannica that have been corrected in Wikipedia">
Wikipedia:Errors in the Encyclopædia Britannica that have been
corrected in Wikipedia</a>.) I don't want to draw too many
far-reaching conclusions here. But it seems safe to say that the
results here show that the current FA review process is unlikely to
ensure perfect factual accuracy. That said, as a non-FA-regular,
perusing the edit history and talk pages for various articles in
this sample has given me newfound respect for the diligence and
efforts of many FA authors and reviewers. I should also say that I
encountered almost no <a class="mw-redirect" href=
"/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" title="Wikipedia:OWN">WP:OWN</a> issues while
implementing the corrections; several of the articles' main authors
reacted very graciously. (Two of my 35 correction edits – for the
<a href="#Oct_19">Oct 9</a> and <a href="#Oct_22">Oct 22</a> TFAs –
were reverted or partially reverted, in both cases because editors
had concerns about the sources supporting the correction; one of
these has since been resolved using different sources.)</li>

</span>A bit of error analysis: What may have caused the mistakes
by Wikipedia or ChatGPT in some of these cases</h4>
</div>
<p>A systematic error analysis (i.e. identifying causes for either
the mistakes ChatGPT identified in the Wikipedia articles or in
ChatGPT's mistaken claims about such mistakes) wasn't the objective
here. But I'll offer a few casual, tentative observations.</p>
<p>Various mistaken error reports by ChatGPT appear to have had to
do with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of access to paywalled/offline sources combined with
<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FUTON_bias" title=
"FUTON bias">FUTON bias</a>/overconfidence (e.g. <a href=
"#Oct_28">Oct 28</a>)</li>
<li>Misreading the Wikipedia article due to parsing fails involving
Wikipedia templates (<a href="#Oct_10">Oct 10</a>, <a href=
"#Nov_1">Nov 1</a>, ...) and tables (<a href="#Oct_26">Oct
26</a>)</li>
<li>Sloppy reading of sources (<a href="#Oct_9">Oct 9</a>, <a href=
"#Oct_24">Oct 24</a>)</li>
<li>In very few cases, outright hallucinations or "r's in
strawberry" type fails (probably <a href="#Oct_20">Oct 20</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Further insights might be obtained by inspecting the "Thinking"
traces and the full list of sources consulted that are included in
each ChatGPT answer. See <a class="external text" href=
"https://chatgpt.com/share/69216aa4-d8a0-8001-be92-180aa4a4fbee"
rel="nofollow">this chat transcript</a> for <a href=
"#Oct_24">October 24</a> as an example, one of the cases where its
correction suggestion went awry – click "Thought" for the former
and "Sources" for the latter. The table below only includes the
sources that ChatGPT included as citations in its final answer.</p>
<p>Apparent causes for some of the identified Wikipedia errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few likely vandalism edits (<a href="#Oct_6">Oct 6</a>,
<a href="#Nov_2">Nov 2</a>) that were overlooked during FA
review</li>
<li>Ironically, one of the factual errors found by ChatGPT appears
to have come from text that was autogenerated without human review
- not by an LLM, though, but by somewhat convoluted template code
to autogenerate alt text (<a href="#Oct_7">Oct 7</a>).</li>
<li>Interdisciplinarity: I'm speculating here, but one of the known
difficulties in writing comprehensive, high-quality Wikipedia
articles is that we are a <a class="mw-redirect" href=
"/wiki/General_encyclopedia" title="General encyclopedia">general
encyclopedia</a> that often covers article topics from the
perspectives of multiple disciplines. And even if an editor is
well-read in one of these, they might have blind spots in others,
and featured article reviews might not always attract reviewers who
can fill all such gaps. A few of the errors that ChatGPT identified
seem of the type that would have immediately occurred to an expert
with "<a class="external text" href="https://xkcd.com/2501/" rel=
"nofollow">average familiarity</a>" in a particular discipline
(e.g. palaeogeology in the dewiki bonus example below).</li>

straddles the Bolivia–Chile border, and the 1904 boundary
description explicitly runs across the NE slope of Licancabur at
~5,400 m (22°49′41″S, 67°52′35″W)—i.e., east of the summit—so the
summit itself lies in Chile. <a class="external text" href=

Chajnantor Observatory is "less than 20 km south" of Licancabur;
using published coordinates for Licancabur (22.83°S, 67.88°W) and
the ALMA/APEX site on the Chajnantor plateau (≈23°00′21″S,

Sexiest Men Alive in 2014." People doesn't publish a numbered
ranking—only a single honoree (in 2014 it was <b>Chris
Hemsworth</b>), plus unranked features/mentions. There's no
official People "#2." (See People's own 2014 coverage and
contemporaneous reports announcing Hemsworth as the sole
winner.)</li>
<li><b>"Alaskan Nets" phrasing</b> In "Acting credits and awards,"
the sentence "According to Rotten Tomatoes, Pratt's most acclaimed
films include ... <b>Alaskan Nets (2021)</b> ..." is misleading:
<i>Alaskan Nets</i> is a documentary he <b>executive produced</b>,
not a film he acted in. (Deadline and Rotten Tomatoes list him as
EP.) A clearer phrasing would note it among his <b>producer</b>
credits rather than "Pratt's ... films."</li>

album in Canada, confirming it's their certification, not RIAA's.

(1939–40).</li>

<td>Here are two concrete issues I found (as of today, Oct 13,
2025):
<p>In the Location section it says the tell is "less than 1 mi
inland." Using the site's published coordinates (31.475817,
34.404631) and the mouth of Wadi Gaza on the coast (~31.46389,
34.37583), the straight-line distance to the shoreline is roughly
2–3 km (≈1.2–1.9 mi), i.e., more than a mile. <a class=

rel="nofollow">Pleiades</a><a class="external text" href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi_Gaza?utm_source=chatgpt.com">+1</a></p>
<p>The infobox lists Ayman Hassouna under "Archaeologists," which
reads as if he excavated the site in 1999–2000. The published
excavation reports name Pierre de Miroschedji and Moain Sadeq as
the excavation directors for the 1999 salvage and the 2000 season;
Hassouna's work at Tell es-Sakan was much later, as field director
for GAZAMAP survey/monitoring in 2022–2023, not part of the
original excavations. So the infobox is misleading as written.

<td><b>Error:</b> In the section "Reaction, later issues and
colonial striking," the article says the silver threepence "was the
same diameter as the groat, <b>and the two coins could not
co-exist</b>."
<p><b>Why this is wrong:</b> The threepence began being issued for
<i>general circulation</i> in <b>1845</b>, and groats continued to
be struck for circulation <b>through 1855</b>—so they <i>did</i>
co-exist for roughly a decade (even though the size clash caused
confusion and helped doom the groat). <a class="external text"

<p><b>Minimal fix:</b> Change to something like: "The threepence,
introduced for general circulation in 1845, was the same diameter
as the groat; although both circulated concurrently until 1855, the
overlap led to confusion and the groat's discontinuation."

factual error and mere awkward phrasing. But ChatGPT is correct

<td>Here's a clear one:
<ul>
<li>In the "Early life..." section, the article says the Pelješac
peninsula "did not have any roads until 1946." That's false.
Pelješac has a historic <b>Napoleon Road</b> (Napoleonova cesta)
built in the early 1800s during the French administration and
extended under Austria, linking settlements across the peninsula.
The Ston Tourist Board describes this route and its phased
construction, and local/official tourism materials note the road
was begun at the start of the 19th century—well before 1946.

Reliable biographical sources say Tomasevich earned his doctorate

<b>Rockefeller fellowship</b>, "availing himself of the rich

<td><b>Error:</b> The lead says: <i>"Through Corymore Productions

<li>Misstated naming history ("Red Bull Highway") The article says
"In the early 1990s, the Iowa DOT designated the entire length of
US 34 as the Red Bull Highway." That's incomplete/misleading. US 34
had already been designated statewide as the <b>34th Infantry
Division Memorial Highway</b> in the late 1940s (contemporary
division newsletter coverage in 1947; road-history compendium dates
the designation to 1948). The early-1990s action was a
re-designation/branding as "Red Bull Highway," not the original
memorial naming. <a class="external text" href=

more appropriate to highlight in such a case than the year when the
work that resulted in that discovery began. But the Wikipedia

factually wrong statements. A correction should also include

<p>ChatGPT is definitely wrong in asserting that <q class=

are from <b>10 Nov 2002</b></q>. However, based on the sources
available to me, I wasn't able to exclude the possibility that it
is <a href="/wiki/Gettier_problem" title="Gettier problem">still
correct</a> in describing the article's "in 2000" claim as wrong.
In some detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT's first citation is titled <a class="external text"

"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327307667_Premieres_photographies_des_differentes_colorations_nuptiales_du_Travailleur_a_bec_rouge_Quelea_quelea_a_La_Reunion"
rel="nofollow">"Premières photographies des différentes colorations
nuptiales du Travailleur à bec rouge Quelea quelea à La
Réunion"</a> and its English-language abstract says <q class=
"inline-quote-talk">The 10/11/2002, on the coast of Saint-Leu, the
first flocks of Red-billed quelea, Quelea quelea were observed.
[...] At the end of December 2002, we observed the different colors
of the breeding plumage.</q> My reading of this is that the paper's
primacy claim (in the title) was about the first photographies of
"different colors of the breeding plumage" (<i>plumage
nuptial</i>), not about the first sighting on the island. And the
abstract's "the first flocks" may solely refer to the first of that
season (2002).</li>
<li>ChatGPT's <a class="external text" href=

<td>Here are (at least) two concrete errors on that page:
<ul>
<li><b>Wrong "Commencement" date in the infobox.</b> It says <i>7
October 1460</i>—but that's the day Parliament opened/assembled,
not when the Act began. The History of Parliament dates the
Parliamentary Accord itself to <b>31 October 1460</b>, and academic
writing also notes the session <b>assembled on 7 October 1460</b>
(i.e., start of Parliament, not commencement of the Act). If
anything, the Act could not "commence" before the settlement was
agreed (31 Oct) or royal assent (commonly given as 25 Oct).

<li><b>Internal date inconsistency (24 vs 25/31 October) + a
miscount.</b> The body text currently claims "<b>On the 24th, this
was passed into law</b>," while the infobox gives <b>Royal assent:
25 October</b>, and elsewhere the article itself implies
promulgation/oaths on the <b>last day of the month</b> (31 Oct).
Authoritative coverage by the History of Parliament explicitly
calls it the <b>"Parliamentary Accord of 31 October 1460."</b>
Also, the lead says the Act was passed on 25 Oct "<b>Three weeks
earlier</b>" York claimed the crown—yet York's dramatic claim is
well-attested at <b>10 October 1460</b>, which is only <b>15
days</b> (≈two weeks) before 25 Oct. Either the "three weeks
earlier" is wrong, or the 25 Oct date is being mixed with the 31
Oct event. <a class="external text" href=

</ul>
<p><i>Optional clean-up:</i> the infobox link labeled <b>"Original
Text"</b> points to a Wikisource page that itself says the text is
taken from <b>Davies (1856), <i>An English Chronicle...</i></b>—a
chronicle extract, not the enrolled statute/roll. If the label is
meant literally, it should point to the Parliament Rolls
(PROME/Rotuli Parliamentorum) or be relabeled to reflect the
chronicle source. <a class="external text" href=

accord/oaths (31 Oct), with inline citations. <a class=

<p>If you want a second one to fix:</p>

<li><b>Image caption:</b> it currently says "Cover of first issue
... <b>in wonton font</b>." That's <b>misleading/unsourced</b>. The
cover (Vol. 1, No. 1, Oct–Nov 1930) is credited as <b>cover art by
Donald von Gelb</b>; there's no evidence a specific typeface called
"Wonton" was used (that term is a generic modern label for a family
of "chop-suey" display styles, not a 1930s font credit). <a class=

<li><b>Leaders captured at the Saw — sequence is wrong.</b> The
lead says the Carthaginians "defeated the rebel field army at the
Battle of the Saw, <b>capturing its leaders</b>." But Polybius (our
best narrative source) states the order the other way round:
Hamilcar first tricked the rebel envoys/leaders (Autaritus,
Spendius, etc.) into custody under a ruse, <b>and then</b> the
leaderless rebels fought and were massacred at the place called
"the Saw." Specifically: he chose the ten envoys and seized the
leaders (1.85.5–6), then the mass killing at "the Saw" followed
(1.85.7); only <b>after that</b> did the Carthaginians march to
besiege Tunis (1.86.1–3).</li>

Polybius does not give a month at all. He says that after the
decisive battle, "the rest of Libya at once submitted,"

soon compelled to accept terms—no "March 237 BC" is specified, and
Tunis is not singled out here. (1.88.1–4).</li>

What Bach actually did was reuse <b>three specific movements</b>

not "most" of either Mass:

<td><b>Error:</b> The lead claims Nizaa is "the only <b>Bantoid</b>
language that allows multiple verbal suffixes on one verb."
<p><b>Why this is wrong:</b> <i>Bantu</i> languages (e.g., Swahili,
Bemba, Chichewa) routinely stack multiple verbal (derivational)
suffixes—this is a well-documented hallmark of Bantu morphology.
And Bantu is a subbranch of <b>Southern Bantoid</b>, i.e., within
Bantoid. So Nizaa cannot be the <i>only</i> Bantoid language with
such stacking. <a class="external text" href=

<p><b>Suggested fix:</b> Change to something like: "Nizaa is
notable <b>among North Bantoid/Mambiloid languages</b> for allowing
multiple verbal suffixes on a single verb," and cite an appropriate
source for the North-Bantoid/Mambiloid rarity rather than using
"only Bantoid."</p>

<p>This is a great example of using LLMs to supplement human
editors, as opposed to outsourcing article creation without human
oversight. I strongly suspect that AI-supplemented human editing
like this is going to be where we finally land. More efficient than
purely-manual editing, but more trustworthy than LLM generation
itself. We already have many "dumber" tools and scripts that made
editing easier. If the WMF wants to invest in AI tech, I hope this
is the direction they take it. <a href="/wiki/User:Thebiguglyalien"

is good work. I've tried similar before with a much lower success
rate, although I suspect that may be it was a much earlier model
and that this sort of task is something models may continue to
improve at. Many years ago there used to be an automated article
peer review generator, so the concept has worked before. This sort
of general assessment could be combined or presented alongside one
of the attempts to use llms to compare article text to attached
sources. <a href="/wiki/User:Chipmunkdavis" title=

</span>Really excellent work -- and I say that as someone who was
"caught out" by it! You've really shown the potential of these
systems to do things humans are not good at and to augment what we
do here. As TBUG says above, this sort of thing ("target
acquisition" for human editors) seems to me to be the real area
where AI can help out on Wikipedia, and it would be nice to have
some streamlined, automated tools to make this more routine -- if
it can help with most of our recent FAs, which have undergone more
scrutiny than any other article on the project, it seems reasonable
to think it could help even more with less developed articles.

<p><span id="c-HaeB-20251201080400-Discuss_this_story"></span>I was
asked how to actually run this ChatGPT request for a new Wikipedia
page, which made me realize that I could have discussed this in
more detail in the article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Running is as simple as typing (say) <q class=
"inline-quote-talk">Find at least one error in this Wikipedia page:
<a class="external free" href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_and_Marisol">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_and_Marisol</a></q>
into the box at <a class="external free" href=
"https://chatgpt.com/" rel="nofollow">https://chatgpt.com/</a>
.</li>
<li>However, one needs at the very least to be logged in to access
the kind of "Thinking" ChatGPT variant used in the experiment
(currently: "ChatGPT 5.1 Thinking", with the "Extended Thinking"
setting) and also to have ChatGPT retrieve the page itself (instead
of it deflecting the request with something like "I can't directly
browse the web or access live content").</li>
<li>Also, I was doing the entire experiment using a paid version
(ChatGPT Plus) and am not sure whether the same model variant is
available in the free version. (<a class="external free" href=
"https://chatgpt.com/pricing" rel=
"nofollow">https://chatgpt.com/pricing</a> says that "GPT-5.1
thinking" is available for free users, but it's not clear to me
whether that includes the "Extended Thinking" setting.) I'm not
trying to drive sales for OpenAI here, just caveating that I can't
vouch for it working similarly well in the free ChatGPT version.
(Also, as mentioned in the article, I would expect that one can
achieve good results with at least the paid versions of Claude or
Gemini, too, provided one uses the reasoning/"thinking" variants of
those models, perhaps having to vary the prompt.)</li>

I've put the headline to something slightly more accurate. You
can't say that the survey of 30 of the 6,821 Featured Articles we
have is enough of a representative sample. What's the problem in
keeping it more accurate to say October's TFAs? It comes across as
misleading clickbait to make it so wide as to cover all articles. -

you don't value honesty or accuracy in your headline. Attempts to
make it both honest and accurate have been reverted. It's shoddy
practice to mislead readers with clickbait. (And, Soni, don't leave
idiotic messages on my talk page about edit warring when you are
equally guilty of doing the same. I had the defence of making the
headline honest; you are just edit warring to pedal lies.) -
