                <p>Bill Murray was the founding Chairman of the AOP in 2002 and served as Board Chair until 2009, ensuring that the organisation was established as a collective voice for online publishers of quality content.  He was also a founder director of UKOM in 2009 and was on the Commercial Board until his passing, playing a pivotal role in the establishment of a UK industry standard for online audience measurement.  Bill’s long career in digital publishing began at Haymarket Media Group in 1986 and continued for over 22 years – he made a significant impact not only on the growth of that business but also to the many people who worked alongside him at that time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Bill Murray Award will be awarded to an individual who is following in Bill’s footsteps through their commitment to making a positive difference within the digital publishing sector.  The winner will be nominated and chosen by the respective board and leadership teams of the AOP and UKOM</p>

<p>The winner of this special award is someone well known to me, someone who’s unwavering support, wisdom, substantial industry knowledge and candour, helps keep me honest and in line and whose backing continues to give me the confidence to execute AOP’s mission on behalf of its members.  Jo is simply the one person you want in your corner. -<strong> <em>Richard Reeves, MD, AOP</em></strong></p>
<p>Jo Holdaway really deserves to receive the Bill Murray Award.  Not only has she made a tremendous difference to the business she works for, but she’s made a big difference to the whole industry.  At both the AOP and the IAB, she’s helped to lead industry initiatives, particularly around data privacy.  So thank you Jo, and very well done! - <em><strong>Jon Mew, CEO, IAB UK</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m absolutely delighted that Jo Holdaway is the winner of this year’s Bill Murray Award. I’ve known Jo well and worked closely with her for 12 years now, and she was instrumental in the early years of The Independent’s groundbreaking journey in digital media long before I joined the mission.  I’ve learnt so much from Jo, but especially the following:</p>
<ul><li>Always think through your own strategy, never jump on bandwagons</li><li>There is usually an answer to every challenge – digital media is a big space</li><li>And don’t be afraid to set big goals – you might just hit them</li></ul>
<p>But the best thing about Jo: they would I’m sure also win every award going for being the nicest person you could wish to meet along the way. - <em><strong>Christian Broughton, CEO, Independent Digital News &amp; Media</strong></em></p>
<p>Jo embodies the definition of a safe pair of hands.  Not only does she always know what needs to be done but she also fully understands why it needs to be done, which is clearly a brilliant combination.  I also assume she has the keys to some kind of time machine because not only does she do a big day job brilliantly, but she also manages to contribute so much knowledge and wisdom to the wider industry through trade bodies and associations.  When you add that she is a trailblazing woman working in the world of digital media and publishing, I think she is the perfect person to win this Award. - <em><strong>Katie Ingram, Director, Advertising Week Europe</strong></em></p>
<p>Jo has been at the forefront of digital transformation for premium publishers.  She was integral to the first digital pure play UK news brand and she’s been a key player in how data is used by publishers, how it’s monetised, and how it continues to help the publishing industry.  A real worth winner. - <em><strong>Philip McMullan, Head of Strategic Insight &amp; Data, Evening Standard</strong></em></p></div>

                                    <div class="formatted"><p>Ryan has been recognised for his contribution to the work of AOP and UKOM as well as to other industry initiatives and organisations – including TAG and the IAB. This Award also celebrates Ryan’s enthusiastic drive to make the digital publishing sector more diverse and inclusive, and of course for his valued contribution to the success of Mail Metro Media.<br /></p>
<h4>Testimonials</h4>
<p><em>"Ryan has been a long time champion for industry standards - and not only in theory but also in embedding their use into all relevant parts of businesses across the industry.</em></p>
<p><em>Ryan’s support for UKOM and the implementation of its industry standard governance is exemplary. Ryan is able to wear the hat of the objective industry representative and is candid on those occasions when his input may be swayed by his own organisation’s interests. He is passionate about digital media, about the engagement of quality audiences online and about the opportunities that are presented by multi-device audiences.</em><br /></p>
<p><em>In a world that knows fierce competition and is sometimes driven less by logic and more by emotion, Ryan’s approach is collegiate and pragmatic. He recognizes the breadth and complexity of online media and has been able to deal with issues that are difficult and politically sensitive from an industry standpoint, with patience, logic and (most importantly) good humour.</em></p>
<p><em>Ryan has gone way beyond the job description in representing the very best of digital publishing and deserves this recognition. Bill Murray would be proud to raise a glass to him." - </em><strong>Ian Dowds, CEO, UKOM</strong></p>
<p><em>"As the founding chairman of AOP in 2002 and founding director of UKOM in 2009, alongside an illustrious 23-year career at Haymarket Publishing, it felt only fitting that we came together to create an award in honour of Bill. This award for outstanding contribution to digital publishing recognises an individual who, and very much in Bill's footsteps, through their tireless commitment and passion, demonstrates their ability to making a positive difference within the digital publishing sector.</em></p>
<p><em>We've witnessed first-hand the objectivity this person applies to their multi representational roles, and across everything they do within their organisation and driving lasting positive change through engagement with their industry peers. The UKOM and AOP Boards cannot think of a more suitable recipient for this, the first Bill Murray award."</em> - <strong>Richard Reeves, MD, AOP</strong></p>
<p><em>"He really is very knowledgeable. He understands the industry. He's been around a while, so he's seen how it's evolved and iterated. He really understands it."</em> - <strong>Jules Kendrick, MD UK &amp; Europe, TAG</strong></p>
<p><em>"That’s amazing news regarding Ryan. In the world of media you come across people who are talented and committed and then you come across someone like Ryan who is the most passionate person I have ever met. In all my years in media I have never met someone who is so committed to the cause - whatever it is. I am lucky to work with someone like Ryan and it’s a honour to be his line manager." - </em><strong>Dominic Williams, Chief Revenue Officer, Mail Metro Media</strong></p>
<p><em>He really cares about the important topics in the industry, the things that other people might just let slip by. He's driven us forward in areas like ID&amp;E, sustainability, the value of publishing. He has made a big difference to both the work that we are doing, but actually the whole industry.”</em> - <strong>Jon Mew, CEO, IAB UK </strong></p>
<p><em>“I want to say thank you so much for seeing the potential in me as a small intern from three or four years ago, and helping me develop and become a strong, independent, confident woman in my career today.”</em> <strong>Freena Tailor, Insight Manager, Mail Metro Media</strong></p>
